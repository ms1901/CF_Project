0	 needed set jumper cables new car good reviews good price used times already supposed complaints say feet really ideal length sure pull front bumper front bumper plenty long lot times beside another car get really close would recommend something little longer great brand get version though always liked using cotton applicators put wax instead foam far best cloth applicators used using meguiar products years never problem waxes make go easy pads come quickly good microfiber cloth happy see meguiar improved already great applicators recommended always keep bottle engine oil trunks vehicles got unlucky bottle leak trunk mazda made realize needed something keep trunk organized keep things sliding around driving rola brand stuff well made durable useful dividers moved around depending want store bottom tacky enough wont slide around definitely solved issue things flying around trunk kept car organized general highly recommended
1	 long cables work fine truck quality seems little shabby side money expecting dollar snap jumper cables seem like would see chinese knock shop like harbor freight bucks test leads way wimpy automotive use ifter couple pulled apart threw rest low grade product camco products quality grade would expect plan lubricating threads simple screw jack first put service operate bind used unlubricated nice item hand see water stopped flowing rv sewer line downward angle also helps stree hose plumbing lighter plug seems well made fits well used go battery minder put different vehicles would buy thankfully jack rv blowout rear highway able get tire changed kept going great little jack heavy truck really love fuse assortment much better deal getting fuses auto parts store certainly reorder run low fuses
2	 comment much since yet used come back update review find issues first use built solid nice tough big hard clamps love long cable never move cars around anything needed bought new truck since always need cables another reason tow travel trailer run batteries shore power may die couple days need quick small recharge perfect length pop hood run cables back truck hook batteries tongue travel trailer running truck minutes nice large gauge wire connected battery tot trailer battery give bit charge ever pinch shore power solar generator recharge bought bucket boss jumper cable bag fit footer perfectly use waste money right easily pay first time need always prepared bought new weight distribution hitch came equipped ball needed ball larger travel trailer wanted one larger big beefy shank wd hitch hole size way would go buy ball smaller diameter shank use spacer want best thickest built ball shank could find ball size larger shank locally price great love big bad boy ball shank pull 6k load trailer still use square aluminum jack stands guess really depends brand something cause pads needed bigger fit mine pleased though anything block tongue parked worked guess need make things tiny bit bigger put picture basic jack stand front till really false advertising cause fit either sets regular square aluminum jack stands got cause like couple bucks sale never know needed seems work great dries white residue leaving behind white lithium grease spray overall works fine come handy price fleetwood prowler two missing bought fit magic chef stove perfect stove top grates fit snug perfect wobble anymore amazon great price shipped mega fast looked descent put travel trailer floor next day floor day double sided tape sucks needs heavy duty industrial type hold double sided tape put see white double sided tape form side looks bit ugly impressed bought different organizers camping world look way better hold perfectly flush past days return sold ebay bucks lost original purchase price would never buy depending surface price guess would okay would hold trailer though needed something plug camping travel trailer monitor volt connected series make one large long lasting 12v battery batteries thing worked perfect turn anything register drop voltage seems show correct battery level perfectly times drops yellow kick heater means showing levels kind load makes monitoring batteries simple want ghetto blue look wanted brighter nice hint whitish look maybe tinge blue really look close original basic cheap sylvania bulbs see hint difference totally yellow really adds tinge mean tinge whitish still primarily yellow saw sylvania silverstar zxe models bulbs looked really blue thought would give ugly blue color went ultras kinda thinking zxe would given look going want regular yellow slight hint white hardly brighter stock good want hid look whiteish look go zxe give want returning zxe hopes wanting research zxe models though bulb blueish reviews say really white wanted know get hid look bulb wanted something close still brightness regular bulbs ok white kinda bright like advertise thought would plus brightness really brighter gmc sierra basic cheap sylvanias overall totally worth money really reviews spot installed gmc sierra 4x4 worked perfect breaking fleetwood prowler travel trailer 5k lbs love screen everything need brake controller would think matches dash lights great colors choose fairly easy install looks lot much better controllers market happy spent money cheaper controllers safety others road cheap lives get quality would go review many reviews said everything would say great unit like feel sturdiness buckles hold tire give piece mind blown leave tire un protected price perfect needed small trash bathroom old travel trailer using one sits floor course bounces around hauled perfect small size mount right next toilet paper roll holder big enough use actual trash say kitchen bathroom perfect give stars cause purpose smaller bathroom exactly mounting bracket great easy removal empty attach camco makes ok rv products fit bill travel trailer really screen door pushes thing holds place hardly ever open door camping comment one negative thing sticking holding velcro love blocks light morning sun totally worth really kinda cheap side though really tiny version cheap walmart car front window shade material opinion bucks overpriced fit need size company makes guess justifies increased price would buy though ever needed new one trick guess bathroom medicine cabinet shelves nothing really hold anything helps stuff falling open first time trip look feel cheap work need get perfect need would pointless large cabinet really need kinda velcro tape hold stuffed tad bit sized standard vent fit snug perfectly sure helps tiny bit holding heat also works block light coming clear vent top great buy really got new trailer wanted make sure tongue ball lubricated bought trailer hitch lubricant says need brush connected cap great fit bill needed perfectly made camco figured would best camping trailer things cost way really anything sort lubricant trick suppose nice addition added rubber coating makes easy handle price steal lubricant grease ball trailer disconnect need something cover rubbed also need something cover ball lubricant stored dirt stuff easily get grease dirty grease maybe small rock particles grinding ball tongue trailer makes sense could find cover anywhere around got amazon worked great
3	 absolutley love amazon price set cheap booster jumper cables brick morter store buy extra long heavy duty jumpers first person needs ask kind passer jump also jumper cables much easier get jump start cables next lets talk sizing longest cable possible major plus car parked something like pole wall even parked one way street booster car car w dead battery pull close enough use cables without manuver akward position better yet push vehicle position jumped diving normal sized car even pull behind jump vehicle shorter two could pull front gauge electricians engineers number value gauge decreases size capacity cable increases example ga twice much copper wire ga ga twice much ga mean double capacity wire every two numbers though gauge may sound like lot really technical stuff worry make sense really need know trying make point get longest heavist cables electrican worked long enough know general rules thumb first enemy electricty resistance resistance ultimately determines load particular wire carry five things factor resistance temperature conductor voltage load distance temp control assume worst hot words need heavier cable conductor copper least high purity mix copper good voltage 12vdc low voltage system probably biggest problem face since low voltage system contend voltage drop travels wire higher voltage longer run acceptable levels voltage drop particular gauge wire since low voltage need heavier gauge wire load amperage car starter takes lot power voltage fixed number less amperage determined size engine trying start surprised high even small engine well cranking amps said even dead battery put power distance cables selling point also draw back long run 12vdc like said last line ga much think fact engine liters really consider ga distance summing layman terms considering hot temperatures outside fact 12vdc need long cable trying start car engine takes lot power cables could reccomend anyone driving small car light truck lets talk properly start car drained battery make sure last connection make neg clamp dead car frame ground something metal moving going move engine compartment attach directly battery neg post next lightly rev engine running vehicle minutes put bit surface charge dead battery attempt start car soon starts remove cables starting neg car jumped ever dead battery reason take auto parts store soon possible tested make sure still holds proper charge places free never touch clamps together connected battery could damage vehicles electrical system cause fire burns explosion battery damages cables couple final thoughts protect investment bought cable bag works really well keep getting tangled everything trunk also keep twist ties come keep organized inside cable bag used take home clean dry storing oils inside engine compartments corrosive rubber jackets copper contacts cables worth weight gold inexpensive top notch quality best cables buy go electrical welding supply company pay probably times cost unless plan start towing service need cables see daily use say gonna work update compairing 4ga cables bought month back car really seem much thicker said much heavier individual stranding thicker gauge model guessing thickness much like length bought half ton pickup never fails battery fail start engine parked packed lot cars sides rather pushing ton vehicle pull booster vehicle close let length work heft cables joke workhorse grade cable lets plenty energy flow trying start 7l v8 kinda important solid clamps unlike reviews problem opening parrot clamps one hand hardly weak clamp solid stay put update really need 2ga booster cables skeptical deka makes set 2ga cables around personal experence little deka name seem pretty good like stiffness flexible hoping flexible expected true welding cable 2ga per foot per cable best jumper cables cost still hoping little thinner stranding promote flexibilty cable clamp like reviews mentioned cable go way copper contact connected jaws instead screwed body clamp copper jaws also screwed body still fine sure buy cables overkill argument people 6ga cheapies start truck fine well attempt addess number terms gauge decreases ammount conductor increases words 2ga perhaps conductor 4ga automatically equate twice much power certainly allow power flow safely aware electrical engineer resistance enemy electrical circuts resistance translates heat way friction two physical surfaces rub together five basic factors contribute resistance give curcuit determine appropriate line size ambient temperature conductor line distance voltage amperage ambient temp control hot bad assume worst means bigger cable overcome additon resistance heat producing conductor copper good want pure least high purity mix copper type conductor distance voltage one cable strengths also happens weakness total run length circut pretty long low voltage system like 12vdc higher voltage longer run given gauge wire without encountering much voltage drop 12vdc drops voltage circuit realatively short distance heaiver gauge lines needed prevent amperage also big consideration amps load pulls resistance circut generate basically small wire large load generate lot heat one two things happen wire melt catch fire load trying power work make mistake starting even small engine takes lot energy bringing together large load low voltage want make lower long distance run means wan heaviest cables find addressing orignal question statment 6ga cables might start small block fine want need extra length need consider heavy gauge cables said personally seen light duty cables melt smoke starting engine big right run close shipped actaully need coleman 4ga booster cables offical training real sizing charts packaging would say 4ga fine length engines liters honestly probably 6l well anything bigger considering something even better also protect investment buy cable bag keep neat protected also keep twist ties came keep organized inside bag arsenal cable organizer works great remember clean inspect cables use prolong life keep safe wanted strainer would fit smaller two sinks tt smaller x lips hang sides sink works well cover becomes tray drainage use counter top lid snaps firmly shut allowing storage items inside travel perfect works well plenty rv park type campgrounds however like scenic view smells wooded campground one problem area country usually

california duster dust build use often enough discovering california duster found washing car could use car cover days car got dusty put cover find keep car dust free use car cover much longer turn means wash car nearly often got plastic handle california duster significantly cheaper time ordered although wood handle one looks classier probably feels nicer plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy value oriented get plastic handle one since exact brush anyway really happy paid calfornia duster would hesitate recommend one anyone car motorcycle aware made car wet dirty complaint actually made calfornia better going local department store buying craftsman brand nozzle instead identical one except green part silver comes lifetime replacement guarantee unlike bon aire one also price said prefer trigger type nozzle turn rotate several revolutions remember spray setting type nozzle may good holding long period time watering garden something like washing car turn water periodically work well trigger type hose nozzle used years car dash vinyl areas interior always thought worked protected pretty well although evaporate inside windshield annoying also seem last long starts wearing dash looks dry since found303 aerospace protectant 32oz works much better seem exhibit aforementioned issues ie seem go inside windshield shine lasts longer also protects uv well better note vinylex

line useful utilitarian attractive item recommend anyone typically lot loose items floating around trunk get organized pump nearly good lead believe leaks car wash liquid microfiber detergent even done continues drip making big mess maybe works better something thicker like wax regret purchase would better pouring liquids container instead good air compressor terms well performs specs etc however disappointed come carrying case like models viair considering one expensive models come way better storing product box vehicle opted purchase bag put compressor fits well hate spend money something included g style mechanics tool fact connects directly vehicle battery plus air compressors past used cigarette lighter however burn fuse quickly model connects battery directly chance burning fuse vehicle sure start engine using drain battery though usage probably could gotten much cheaper lower powered black decker model plugs cigarette lighter without problem would take longer enjoyable use however would saved hard earned money another negative battery jumpers really small even fit entire battery terminals tiny clamps much bigger use viair model lighter plug conjunction adapterroadpro 12v battery clip cigarette lighter adapter find battery jumpers bigger clamp battery much better product shine black plastic trim shine seems last longer dressing type products however make faded black trim black enough mostly adds shine really add much black back also expensive tiny little nail polish bottle size bottle price know would purchase runs useful device anyone takes road trips charge laptop well iphone ipad time via built usb charge port car trip via accessory power jack car traveling kids charge nintendo ds systems etc also need power something takes power power drill something like need plug directly car battery avoid blowing accessory jack fuse car nice comes types plugs would also recommend car running burn car battery however device include alarm beeps car battery getting low supposed warn point car battery drains point able start car although tried yet unit lighter feels bit less quality expected price remains seen reliable long term said appears functioning well far good disposable rags use around house car etc quite thin would plan washing use multiple times could try using washing twice using ware blue dye get things wash would recommend wash separately warned tried washing white rags white rags turned sky blue use wipe car motor clean wheels things like nice mess nice microfiber towels uses waxing car get dirty throw away since hassle try wash worth used mother car head light lenses completely cloudy using look lot clearer product easy use results quite good still lot product left however sandpaper pieces came used wish included glass sealant seems work well necessarily better rain x also appears last amount time glass much prefer bottle applicator versus rain x however would likely buy whichever cheaper next time since performance product seems well made quality item cables seem high quality unit really charger car battery maintainer driving vehicle parked outside park near window use keep battery draining modern day cars drain nature electronic devices powered time mention alarms drive weeks battery may drained using device solve issue nice comes lighter port plug well direct battery terminal plugs includes ones come bad price get even though last long seems like pretty good deal definitely like fact microfiber rather cotton great idea lot potential however product quite yet install process bit kludgy insert device car obd ii port times could recognized app still would work right iphone app supposed crash report feature set notify someone choosing case accident however feature found within app first contacted automatic customer support said link device needed firmware update happens automatically app iphone via bluetooth next time drove updated background feature appeared app app read fault codes output vehicle tell wrong also let turn check engine light car trouble yet chance try aspect device app one feature clearly missing app however ability use standard obd ii terminal advanced programming vehicle options toyota prius example allows one program disabling reverse beeping entering coding connected obd ii port using text terminal automatic allow functionality also beep link device makes warning hard braking strong acceleration etc sounds really cheapy price charged device nicer tone tone like would find dollar store digital watch believe platform lot potential improvement excited see third party developers able accomplish future would like display real time engine information like rpm temperature etc app basically meant display anything drive calculates report turn car fact car already gives mpg driving feedback built add useful would someone car already features built originally purchased thought condo complex live allow washing cars hose turned

908	 another reviewer mentioned charger puts 0v agm mode many volts agm batteries caused outgas reducing battery life optima yellow top agm battery rated 15v charging thought charger would okay charger got puts 5v find specs say 6v regulated voltage okay rapid charging battery define rapid charging means say 6v charge current drops amp think means 6v battery gets closer charged stops accepting high amperage unfortunately charger exact opposite starting lower voltage increasing 5v around decides battery charge seems equate 7v battery charger keeps outputting 5v battery fully charged may take hours seems unlikely good batteries pretty sure charging specs battery note charger shows 4v readout volt meter shows actually 5v nevertheless let keep 5v checked periodically make sure battery hot never even felt warm ir temperature gun read 86f max hissing hissing would mean overcharged releasing gas permanently reducing life took almost exactly hours charger decide charged go maintenance mode picked 4v agm batteries supposed charged around 6v maintenance float charging idea picked 4v left another hour actually reduced voltage point took charger volt meter said battery 31v decide charger broken weird charging algorithm actually smart say battery discharged 5v weeks ago well voltage designed discharged deep cycle even deep cycles tolerate discharging even 5v may hurt damaged hold full 6v supposed instead leave charger 5v hour hits 8v quickly loses charge 5v minutes maybe charger somehow figured decided 4v full charge damaged battery used float charge see could determine battery 8v higher long 5v charge knows also know 4v really bad battery average agm spent awhile researching find real authoritative information bunch people theorizing since 15v standard charge battery spec sheet think good thing also found research nrel dot gov vehiclesandfuels pdfs evs17pres pdf showing seriously yellow top battery 17v certain conditions actually increases life know think leaning towards thinking bad thing go manufacturer spec sheet unless lab using specialized chargers know desulfination feature charger thing damaged battery fact think even kicked connected charger small sealed lead acid battery left unused long went desulfination mode think manual say supposed know hours pumping 8v battery said bad bat screen stopped charging time battery never showed charged charger though end holding 9v online research mentioned places studies showing desulfination actually works pretty dubious definitely work either batteries also interesting note sealed lead acid battery never got warm find rather curious considering long putting high voltage charger connected kill watt meter showed charger pulling 15amps 9watts 2amp charging mode maybe charger smart enough use low amperage using high voltage prevents battery getting damaged pushing 4v agm battery drawing 35amps actually reduced amps got closer charged maybe protects battery overvoltage damage know enough sure maybe battery expert chime comments another important thing consider desulfination mode could damage car electronics remove battery car charge 8v cars designed handle found someone mentioning bmw warns use chargers things like definitely concern know feel comfortable using charger without removing battery car chargers claim somehow magically detect presence car electronics limit voltage charger says nothing manual design charger nice wires fit pocket beneath retractable handle show battery voltage readout tell start charging although reads 2v lower volt meter annoying button lets toggle display voltage battery percent lets choose standard agm gel cell choose three rates charge slower 2a charge rate supposed better many batteries use 2a 6a hurry tried modes still puts 5v 6a mode puts 3v 2a mode since dedicated 12v charger worry autodetecting actually auto discharged 12v battery 6v never charging past 6v problem far many chargers days despite nice controls smart form factor give charger low rating think tries push batteries beyond limits name charging quickly fully possible one reviewer said caused agm outgas another said burnt battery months trickle charge mode right brand battery handle charger output battery damaged probably fine fact damage things may even damage car electronics desulfination mode strikes bad design especially given desulfination seems like marketing ploy valuable feature also like volt meter reads 2v actual voltage considering stands cost four times much lot others considering five star reviews expecting perfection unfortunately

fully engage even locking bar rusty enough prevent weight yellow bar fully locking weight car certainly could possibly imagine case tip locking bar barely touching tooth yellow bar putting weight yellow could cause failure get sit like trying pretty unlikely however jacks get rusty teeth possibly wear simply get one small manufacturing defect situation could become likely fan design locking easily confirmed visually even made locking arm sits perfectly horizontal locked inch horizontal unlocked would better tests locking bar created quite bit shaved yellow paint particles moving yellow bar hand probably typical paint used jack stands maybe avoiding certainly seem used sort premium paint coating yellow paint seem thicker coating blue paint least think description ton label stand

deeper place grease zerk using gun easy press trigger little bit grease automatically pumped grease fittings hand fatigue useless time wasted trying fill fitting grease one things like lincoln industrial incorporated cover cap gun well great option done using gun slide cap onto end coupler keeping grease getting contaminated dirt conclusion best grease gun ever bought made awesome brand like lincoln industrial extremely durable despite negatives really like gun tell going get lot use gun old one gun necessary home owner per say absolutely necessary small engine automotive shop wanted quickly review product tell experience used teflon plumbers tape make sure connections sealed tightly would lose air first separator functioned great year kept moisture air tools however year later separator formed crack acrylic housing began leaking much air caused compressor turn every minutes understand used acrylic person could tell full water needed drained point however acrylic matter thick designed hold pressure psi pressure per square inch since air tools require psi separator stand pressure long think would make better solution make separator metal since hold great pressures
