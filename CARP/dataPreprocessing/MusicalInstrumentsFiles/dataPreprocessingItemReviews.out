comfortable considerably flexible mm difference account like bend strings acoustic certain contexts tough tight strings exp feel easy electric easy mind fine acoustic quality noticeable sustain strings took completely dead expecting dramatic difference noticable across board especially small chord comping three four strings time tone also feels bit balanced across six strings admittedly subjective play differently shaped thicknessed picks different recording contexts generate percussive pick noise others sometimes want times response exps sounds consistent ears couple weeks playing

regularly clean even boil bass players still coated strings simpler alternative strings similar ones like elixirs thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded wrappings accomplishes two things first creates barrier atmosphere metal wrap prevents rust corrosion second provides physical barrier prevents contamination getting windings strings stay fresher sounding two three times long standard strings sound bit less bright equivalent uncoated strings huge difference month two still sound also cost twice much equivalent non coated addarios worth depends active performer maybe probably changing strings every performance make sure getting bright sound probably also buying strings box real benefit strings really pay casual player may dozen spare sets handy days strictly hobbyist might

sensitive singing echoey room behind pick think make sound like dead control room unless actually one hang blankets acoustic foam behind set records twice dry condenser takes reverb pretty well mix

300	 recently switched blackstar ht fender mustang iii v2 amp although fender great sounding amp get natural warmth get tubes liveliness missing although cleans sound good great although overdrive sounds good great although distortion well get picture since adding pedal less expensive buying new amp decided give try pedal adds kind sparkle sound would get using clean boost tube amp believe people call pixie dust little bit magic makes sound come alive interestingly enough leave pedal time stack pedals use certain effects like chorus shimmer reverb effect exception maybe leslie pretty awesome works different eq tube amp clean boost may thing think really adds life solid state amps hard really describe pedal distort flange echo produce chorus heard described making amp sound like someone thrown blanket words accurate job describing would probably never pulled trigger one even though pretty cheap pedals go luck would acquired one trade admit agree whole blanket euphemism stompbox helps correct boxy sound blues jr placed end pedaltrain right run amp feel needs run dedicated effects loop improve amp tone though believe works even better loop placed effects loop palomino v8 usa ampeg made crate vc508 watt usa made el84 tube amp celestian speaker transformative amps tone great way well single coils pedal would leave time tone dialed think works well run lp jet city combo particularly trying coax subtle textures harmonics amp also lacks effects loop imagine would different effect placed preamp phase guess rig dependent keeper sound fender great pedal put end fx chain last pedalboard gnx4 always took week settle liked adjusted two knobs played around untill happy sound lot recording also checked sound recording reccomend enough especially considering price like good pedal end line tone adjustments like pedals pedal seems like always need another one add pedals shaping tone settle setting like adds subtle noticeable addition sound pedal essentialy balances high mid low frequencies yout instrument produces also software version effect daw pedal great job giving instrument balanced full tone switch allmost sounds like someone took blanket amplifier highly recomend pedal musicians jangly pop stuff real peaky bitey blues material think albert collins likely add little mean little extra oomph sound sounds like uses touch reverb dash higher end mids make cleans sound sparkling also able get sounds hughes kettner statesman watt amp running straight heard adds nothing use fair amount distortion music definitely add fatness overall impression box provides thing people swear get copper bracelets arthritis feeling better increased vitamin e regimen words matter head suggestable musicians already use eq reverb careful tweaking two things obtain think getting pedal think going explaining science behind pedal works going focus review pedal affects tone definitely boost also eq bbe sonic stomp uniquely functioning pedal ear serves add clarity depth body tone essentially pedal allows get tones amp already producing lo contour knob increase amount bass produced amp rather tightens generally increases depth bass low mid tone ear may sound first like bass increased hearing bass tone first place jumbled signal went amp process knob really focuses treble high mid frequencies frequencies often unpleasant grating hear sonic stomp sort evens smooths tones clearer less harsh say dial aggressive cutting highs play lead metal something indeed make searing lead tones even better gave product stars issues way unsatisfied rather really fairly subtle effect first almost tell difference time able better recognize appreciate impact tone make night day difference recommend pedal someone already tone happy want make even better pedal make cheap watt solid state combo sound like tube half stack make love tone completely unsatisfied conclusion though definitely put pedal must category definitely improves quality tone pedal leave time improves clean distorted tones pedal adds know sound chased sound years buying pedal difference great top quality cable quiet amps pedal boards shielded guitars fresh tubes know drill spend thousands chasing something hear head plug one pedal whamo pedal turn knobs comes speakers must especially playing clubs bars arenas pedal board looking sound gonna finally push sound front give notes clarity leads make overdriven chords ring like pedal board never coming back used ampeg head effects loop discovered rack version bbe music store amazed money amp totally bad ass fryette deliverance sadly effects loop thought luck far bbe goes far knew available rack mount units could placed anywhere effects loop looking pedals amazon lo behold bbe sonic maximizer pedal snatched quickness pleased sounds good rack version one caveat signal noisy bbe actually increase signal noise reason highly recommend using top quality patch instrument cables clean noisy aspects sound use pedal subtle

529	 satisfied performance cm tweaking could emulate sound get fulltone ocd say versatile two seperate controls low high frequencies unlike pedals tone control toggle switch lets choose classic modified setting tweaker delight level knob lot juice set clock plenty loud enough although use clean boost gives little gain even set gain knob zero single coil may sound like tube amp breaking humbuckers much gain also stack cm pedals dusted old boss ds run along cm able get good tones ds usually hurts ears cm behind sweet hardwire cm may exotic boutique offerings klon zvex lovepedal get job done significantly lower cost well built take pounding gigging musician subject may others better cost twice price twice good try go wrong update full comparison cm fulltone ocd joyo crunch distortion gain joyo obviously gain followed closely cm ocd 3rd mix cm amount control separate high low controls followed ocd tone control joyo crunch less sounds matter position put tone control since cm widest tone range make behave like treble booster nuance ocd cleans well roll volume control dynamic cm close second joyo crunch strictly distortion pedal far behind first like distortion pedals instead making fender blues deville sound distorted make sound like amplifying distorted pedal difference think get second like lot pedals play rock country band play music sounds like neil young tom petty ccr etc simple clean rock roll mix chords occasional minor 6th want overdrive digitech bad monkey arion tuner need distortion covers ac dc hendrix etc deville hendrix turn course loud based criteria digitech cm perfect classic overdrive setting allows sound like hendrix rocking neil young rock band 60s 70s modern setting allows sound like 80s 90s rock e g guns n roses soundgarden important settings make amp sound like overdriven sounds like tubes pushed breaking point sounds fricken awesome sound like amplified pedal use bad monkey reviewed amazon want read boosting clean sound use cm want play dirtier covers two pedals plus tuner play everything want happy anything like know thinking digitech digital fake sounding junk anymore digitech hardwire cm finishes digitech began bad monkey great overdrive pedal right cm offers tone quality compares best market pedal maniac owned wayyyy many overdrive distortion pedals humility know talking flexibility rivaled none market anything close price makes cm great like several reviews mentioned another tube screamer clone distinct mid range hump slightly rolled bass tubescreamers particularly ts known lot range knobs level add serious boost bass treble knobs allow significantly change tone dial never completely transparent also cm gain tap overdrive pedals go basically clean boost adding surprising amount saturation tone lastly classic vs modified switch gives option adding gain bass switching classic modified tested cm overdrive clean channel fender hotrod deville front end boost bugera basically marshall jcm cm sounds great applications clean channel fender sounds full smooth even turned way overdrive never sounded grainy fuzzy maintained warmed organic tube like boutique esque would characterize great blues playing sure playing tone knobs could dial good country tones well however use front end boost already overdriven bugera amp front lead channel cm serves take tone hard rock crunch territory metal tone chunky bass roaring highs make palm muted riffs sound home coming peavey conclusion really pleased quality digitech cm sound build quality top notch price similar less quality overdrive pedals market highly recommend checking cm one pedal without sculpt tone hits amp key getting tight rhythm tone high gain encounter amp tight enough high gain distortion sound good turn gain use lower gain channel hit hard pedal sounds much better internal high gain distortion alright things might want know buy gain knob turned zero still produces overdrive use clean boost pedal high output humbuckers still get mild tube like overdrive zero gain advertised clean boost pedal much gain distortion pedal going clean channel amp plenty classic rock blues enough metal though crank gain high knob way barely get prog style metal tone distortion pedal overdrive thing uses tiny smc components circuitry therefore really moddable unlike bad monkey additional mixer cabinet emulated output like tube screamer boosts mids reduces bass going mushy sounding tube channel get tighter distorted sound anyone nice warm amp gets pedal thinking get may disappointed need instead transparent clean boost pedal keeps tone louder volume classic modified switch pretty cool two guitars one kind bassy scooped sounding bright middy well using switch make one come equivalent needed keeps adjusting amp time switch guitars classic slightly lower gain mid boosted sound quite tight think peavey eq structure modified scooped saturated think mesa eq structure switch useful little bonus eats batteries sucking around 9v mah rechargeable lasts hrs swear blue led bright would probably get extra hour instead getting adapter got battery aa clip 9v battery clip 12v dc plug sanyo eneloop batteries hooked negative tip positive sleeve mah monster hours play time pedal perfect get advertised rugged looks good found noisy unless something wrong strings grounded bridge etc someone mentioned silver tops dials falling decals looked knobs seem like one solid piece another thing found instead using overdrive plugin daw use real overdrive pedal front interface magically makes hum noise pickups go away overall yes highly recommend would suggest people check hardwire metal distortion want something standalone rather overdrive crunchy amp like others though stop playing great purchase especially bought used

admittedly sort niche product overall however several amplugs choose choose one still incredible value ability play virtually anywhere enjoy quality tone tone real sweet spot really makes enjoyable play lead notes necessarily ideal rhythm distortion hit rich chords nice sustain prefer tone higher gain levels really crank want sounds great lower volumes delay also surprisingly good probably set

always thought satch technical melodic guitarist metal guitarist cons things know satriani signature model think discourage checking delay surprisingly good customize make repeats shorter longer adjust timing repeats keep mind mostly practice device personal use however still enjoy using delay tone mostly discussed pro paragraph aware meant clean signal possible get somewhat clean tone rolling back gain lowering volume mostly distortion bust durability amplugs also questioned device lightweight plastic except metal plug portion doubt could bang something break quite easily switches dials may also fail time frankly probably better value making heavy duty metal charging would lock people market would certainly buy another one several mine broke finally audible hiss noise

737	 purchased amp locally initially thought pretty cool first modeling amp lots potential limitless variety sounds first fender amp well presets neat played around standard models amp model effects see clean sound amp hissed volume cranked distortion pedal engaged max master volume effects turned never heard clean channel much noise behind even plugged could hear playing underlying hiss coming notes distracting drove nuts ground loop issue amps sound fine bedroom volumes beyond clearly defect product dirty pre sets lots gain extra volume sound even worse even nothing plugged low master volume think running super high gain stomp boxes red hot single coil nothing plugged get staticy hiss low levels wtf next issue weird fizz sound especially noticeable low e striking string instead clean note weird fizzy digital artifact like sound surrounds note fades string stops moving almost sounds like cymbals crashing poorly authored mp3 file low bit rate frequency whole chords break decay fizzy envelope really makes thing unplayable weird thing neither one problems arose head phones plugged connected computed via either usb line going stuck playing watt amp pc cans got iii instead ii power behind touted celestion speaker read many reviews online forum posts many amp related websites page forum post fender support site quite interesting find amps issues apparently mustang ii issues

poor headphone amp quite problem behringer headphone amp ok specifically output impedance ohms rule thumb good headphone amp matching output impedance impedance headphones hd ohms impedance breaking rule get distortions frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass manufacturers list output impedance possibly embarrassed anyway focusrite one reason trust little output impedance less ohms

computer really stripped performance using behringer good latency time playing note hearing speakers ms using behringer really perceptible unfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently anything like acceptable latency lowest latency could set get sound instead crackles pops ms level instrument begins sound sluggish laggy difficult least work large latency like ready return device decided last ditch effort install asio4all sort asio driver use absolutely cannot make manufacturer driver perform decent level installed worked output latency tiny ms actually output latency really impressive conclude hardware good machine software horrible unfortunately actually uninstall focusrite driver otherwise windows recognize device never even turns class compliant unlike behringer two drivers installed one use bad news configuration buggy general turn computer try play vst instrument get crackles pops open asio configuration panel increase buffer funny thing matter

often see artists trimming tuning putting capo one even light gauge strings must admit surprised taking right wrapper going tuning procedure get spot immediately job right even little bit sharp super
