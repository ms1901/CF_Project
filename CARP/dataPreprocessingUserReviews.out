10	 monster makes wide array cables including some very high end initially purchased pair ofmonster rock instrument cable feet angled straight inch plugto use keyboards when came time purchase cables bass thought d pinch few pennies am so glad did compared cable model more expensive models previously purchased aside from looks could detect any difference sound swapped back forth between guitars keyboards ensuring each model was used each instrument still no difference what more expensive model has going looks am sure higher priced model even more sturdy because molded stress relief ends model seem make more reliable than its pricier sibling bottom line carefully compare both cables using your own instrument amp if possible before making purchase decision may find did higher price does necessarily equal higher value even from same manufacturer first reasons why awarded five stars construction uniformly excellent both ends strain reliefs connecter perfectly mates plug into which insert xlr end quality component purchased specifically transform third channels mypowerwerks watt personal p systeminto something more useable greatly expands functionality versatility portable pa by allowing me plug another mic since three those units daisychained was able significantly enhance entire system simple adapter another reason why love noise free some environments which play there sources electromagnetic interference cheap cables will pick up transmit had problem one so another plus overall am very pleased adapter actually purchased spare case damage or lose primary one bit pricier than others considered feel quality peace mind worth premium purchased when was sale during christmas season figured asking price at time could go wrong expectations were frankly low had heard nothing horrible things about epiphones main complaint being they would stay tune other complaints included poor overall quality terrible playability what received was polar opposite received an instrument strikingly beautiful finish one stays tune amazingly was close being perfect tune when unboxed am wild about strings came stock am drummer suffer same disappointment about heads ship new drums guess guitarists expect change strings new same way drummers do when comes heads near future intend restring withd addario ecg25 chromes flat wound electric strings light which while thick should make instrument jazz friendly realize flatwound strings will require new set up intonation considering how good how relatively little cost me new strings work will be an investment out box though action was reasonably low frets appeared novice eyes fingers be properly dressed already invested good great case guardian hardshell electric caseto store also uploaded customer provided photo page shows case how well fits record use following amp which also reviewed perfect match kustom defender watt class headthat run through akustom defender x extension cabinet 5h head bottom line great instrument beginners bad one experienced players price right quality clearly shows off shore manufacturers made significant improvements over past year use fairly light mics seenady dmk drum mic

surface keep them off floor stand will reach any stand chair seat height larger amps floor or tiltback stands mic stand will still allow position mic where need use relatively narrow kick drums amps each stand excellent opinion mics am using heavy enough remain stable where need place those mics allows me do so relative ease definitely high quality cable however experience model less expensivemonster standard instrument cable ft straight plugs s100 21model has shown me only difference one prettier its gold colored bling fittings sonically found them be same or ears anyway can see by tag above review amazon has verified purchased cable well amazon verifying purchase less pricey model review product page initially purchased pair these cables keyboards because had invested significant sum into those instruments wanted nothing best cables purchased standard cables some low end instruments including an old squier jazz bass new very inexpensiveepiphone lp special ii les paul electric vintage sunburst neither which mind warranted top line cables much surprise when started testing each cable each instrument all through same amp keep things equal could discern any sonic difference between both monster cable models same manufacturer different models be sure more expensive model looked cooler when came sound no discernible difference could detect anyway more perplexing molded stress relief ends less expensive model seem make one more reliable recommendation test both one standard model side by side before plunking down extra money no added value beyond looks which admit may be selling point stage some folks no shame long know what paying extra why one thing love about extension bar will fit over relatively large diameter down tubes hi hat stands use anon stage microphone inch gooseneckto connect bar then attach either anady dm70 drum instrument microphoneor dm80 microphone bar gooseneck arrangement sturdy enough mic model also works well mounting microphone stands use shorter gooseneck mount dm70 tenor alto saxophones or dm80 baritones again works perfectly situations always keep few these plus various size goosenecks just case need mount an additional microphone am short stands one more tool make set up less stressful trust me when need one chances will if re drummer or sound tech will thank yourself having foresight purchase situations cited above those foreseen nearly identical theguardian cases cg b bass caseat about half cost however there some issues case well limitations first issues while covering appears be stitched most part glued if case left hot unventilated space like car prolonged periods covering will start life at edges other hand someone who takes care their gear probably going leave their instrument hot car or garage or other storage space prolonged periods however should be aware issue if no other reason than remind if they case suffers imagine effect your bass limitations simple case while hard shell design strong one made from abs plastic top relatively flimsy sides show stopper if use case home storage occasional gigs if heavy road schedule especially personally loading unloading band gear case will afford protection an ata style case also note only used case fender jazz bass so any long scale j or p style basses will fit cannot be sure about other brands models mentioned an ata style case better solution essential protecting your instrument if heavy road or even local gig schedules less demanding protection recommend also consider case which purchased an upgrade when became aware issues limitations musician gear model skb electric bass rectangular hardshell standard latches handle if still opt musician gear case still getting relatively good value certainly making large step up from soft gig bag ordered these both spare use lower end keyboard casio px so could leave expensive roland rd 300nx home studio much surprise cable pro quality noise free mymonster rock instrument cable cannot tell difference between two cables when am using one either or keyboards remainder review going compare cable monster model ll give monster cable plus outer jacket overall construction where matters signal transmission frankly cannot tell two apart part reason may be cable uses both foil braided shielding minimize handling emissions noise am sure oxygen free copper conductor also has something do both every expensive monster cable one share some high end components construction love strain relief cable more than one monster does better job holding flex minimum although connectors monster better quality bottom line monster cable wins out few places one no slouch or cheaply made piece junk fact will probably keep monster cables home studio switch completely model gigging one thing there no discernible degradation sound quality one another costs fifth what paid monster even if insist using more expensive cables great one spare use when myon stage microphone inch gooseneck blackare too long what want do sometimes rare occasions used extend length model mic mainly use anady dm70 drum instrument microphone which small relatively light works saxophones well drums cymbals when am using mic alto tenor sax use anon stage my550 microphone extension attachment barto clamp pole regular microphone stand attach gooseneck dm70 without using separate mic stand because its bigger sibling so versatile keep few each size around plus supply extra extension attachment bars some situations they can be savior during set up will empahsize though anything larger than dm70 or

simply add anon stage msa7040tb adjustable microphone boom blackand re good go addition being indestructible stand takes up far less stage or studio real estate than tripod type stand like theon stage

extended found stand be stable outside use fair breezes stand remains upright which always case tripod types moreover there no legs break lost one tripod stand problem if transport your gear often especially if play outside or inside cramped stages stand best choice opinion use mount hi hat or cymbal stands well mic stands see customer supplied photos at top page examples one thing love about

high quality mounting screws components eliminating expense was expecting orderraxxess rack screws washers hardware pack which turned out be completely unnecessary only complaint rubber feet caps easily fall off little glue rectified rather trivial problem if need portability reliability value smaller gear suites frequently moved such setting up stages an ideal solution rack mounted equipment am so pleased mine intend purchase another one bringing total three construction set superb ends heavy duty strain reliefs xlr connectors well made perfectly mate receptacles devices being patched probably biggest plus cable itself which appears be heavy gauge certainly thicker than other patch sets built last addition love attention detail form color coding which makes tracing cables behind rack lot easier patch cables from different brands set does stand out its quality when compared others price so close more generic ones been using am switching over brand future needs mine attached one support arms myon stage ks8291xx pro double x keyboard stand while attachment designed both square round tube supports was unable use anon stage tier folding z keyboard standeven top tier removed

other mic holder clear can gain an additional ashure a26x mic mount extension tube rock solid throne has wide adjustment range height workable range backrest height backrest fixed can adjust how far back can be moved am referring lateral motion tilt angle seat itself has nice comfortable padding about par mid range drum throne apologize best reference comparison assembling simple fast had some issues lining up seat height stemmed from need perfectly align two outer two inner holes frame seat bar after getting feel tight tolerances managed get done no problems another thing note primarily guitarists foot rests going be much used by drummers particular nor by keyboardists whose feet will probably be busy sustain expression pedals however still ideal keyboardists because seat comfortable backrest promotes good posture used drums be aware seat will swivel so front bar across bottom can interfere pedals your snare drum stand unless move back bit final note heavy somewhat clunky transport deal breaker contrary will reduce performance fatigue because ergonomic design alone offsets any inconvenience purchased handling convenience more than any other reason useon stage ss7761b tripod speaker stands which light duty awkward carry case solves problem when mentioned light duty title truly meant while gig twenty times per month nearly all totally acoustic small powered speaker rooms where pianist vocalist has project over grand piano very rare occasions do we need full pa where case comes handy moving individual speaker stands from vehicle performance area awkward transporting them case isn these hold up beautifully if used three or four times per month when full pa needed am sure would want them heavier all metal speaker stands because weight would quickly wear case out has reinforced stress points still feel those adequate heavier stands can easily fit two stands mentioned above aon stage stands ms7701 tripod boom microphone stand side pocket good incidentals like xlr inch adapters patch cables like bottom line case occasional use only even then lighter stands awarded five stars because does exactly what need touted be anything light weight case instant order update notice shows purchased december during time ve owned cable has been heavily used still noise free perfect all respects context purchased connect mic tube pre amp mixer so has been set up torn down many times past two half years key points earn five stars heavy duty strain reliefs which keep inside conductors from bending stressing am guessing those why patch continues be noise free provide strong signal also xlr connectors highest quality past cut corners only find small details like connectors do always mate well so these they engage disengage without binding or looseness bear mind they been frequent use inserted removed hundreds times outer jacket fairly thick which me an indication manufacturer did cut corners when cable was constructed overall am pleased because patch has withstood lot use has held up perfectly would hesitate purchase more brand model if need additional ones had two these wound up selling one because never used one kept currently serving keyboard amp two keyboards simultaneously aroland rd 300nx digital stage pianoand aroland v combo key stage keyboard was able do because there two inputs front amp input designed normal sensitivity input designed guitars active pickups thus far had no problems both boards connected at same time does seem matter which board connected which input sound impressive exceptionally clean amp provides controls allow contour your sound which helps significantly when running keyboards through moreover amp loud if choose make so even at high gain settings has ample headroom if want distortion probably amp can switch from clean drive more drive essentially still clean sounding amp find be plus met share guitarists who think otherwise another great feature can daisychain these amps using pre out master pwr aux amp can also use these two jacks run an effects loop personally no use those features can see how they could be useful overall love amp wish fender made single model because pretty heavy bulky those hardly significant complaints since sometimes regret selling second one because if something happens one still would replace immediately owned few these they hold up perfectly what love they do introduce noise signal path some nice touches way they made one those nice touches strain relief at both ends which will prolong life cable well prevent micro breaks conductor can will introduce noise static eventually plugs also highest quality they mate perfectly receptacles guitars amps mentioned these inside playing what mean outside gigs rough concrete cobblestone similar surfaces outer jacket will fray cable dragged across surface negative aspect jacket much reality material from which jacket made otherwise bargain when consider quality price performance get one spare if no other reason because think will be pleased ve been playing brother lunchbox when he first plugged jam at his house thought he was joking amp can easily cut through drums even close confines his practice studio granted am heavy hitter we were messing around come classic rock from early 60s amp at three volume knob was plenty loud tone very good exceptional clean fender or jazz chorus still better than many amps ve listened if want make spectacular tome machine plug aboss fbm fender bassman pedalinto about quirks ambiance knob no substitute reverb does give hall like sound increase was designed simulate an open back amp more than true effect gain controls input signal amp according manual more like soft overdrive volume level solely controlled volume knob gain knob playing no real role how loud amp gets finally speaker switch rear turning internal speaker off speaker out circuit routing signal an external cab means can use ths amp head by turning inch internal speaker off or active cab set external speakers addition internal one plugging phones into headphone jack will turn off internal speaker need do speaker switch personally love feature because can also use phones jack an output pa amp internal speaker still active definitely need follow instruction manual especially advanced user guide or may be initially disappointed brother returned first unit he purchased because there was pop when was turned or off well slight hum when was idling replacement amp exhibited same problems however if follow manuals plural can prevent both problems mentioned quirks power off procedure positioning gain knob mid level keys smoothing amp out bottom line tiny amp packs punch has sound characteristics be heard believe if want true reverb will need plug pedal check out theboss frv fender reverb pedalif haven already small venues practice rooms ambiance feature probably all need do take time read documentation before start using because when amp properly used simply amazing was leery since was half total price just about every other one considered because return policy took chance am only glad did am also thoroughly impressed hanger first doubt if could build one anywhere near price if purchased materials locally factor shipping at time purchase free no brainer installation also no bainer made so by mounting hardware comes hanger there one concern may if instruments nitrocellulose finishes protective rubber sleeves hanging fork may eat into those finishes personally mine being used hang cheap squire strat j bass an epiphone les pail junior ii instruments more decorative than functional am saying sleeves will ruin finish merely raising possibility help make purchase decision bottom line though if hanging guitars do nitrocellulose finish these hangers bargain fact they probably best deal likely find worth every cent purchased add basic effects small pa based daisy pw50 portable pa systemheads got lot more than bargained effects beautifully done reverb sounds natural there wide range choices both reverb echo record keep mine set at club wet dry knob set straight o clock position wet means more effect dry means less there mic gain left side unit mic input xlr only has phantom power xlr out goes straight your mixer there also usb port software do use so cannot speak feature unexpected bonus device tone feature which leave adds dimension vocals does interfere them does alter them ways mechanical sounding can set minor major pitch correction suspect most folks will want less than more overall perfect addition vocalist toolbox because straightforward use relatively inexpensive also perfect adding vocal effects small bare bones pa systems transformed mine from essentially loudspeaker true pa

18	 before pay some tech fix knobs switches your stomp box or amp try time will take care problem if your amp cuts out also try spraying effects loop pushing jack out socket dozen times very first can bought probably paid itself hundred times over good stuff let me start by saying am huge fan dano stomp boxes probably own close dozen from various lines they make pedal does decent job covering your tremolo needs imho tremolo from dano cool cat line much more durable pedal only more at time review switches knobs pedal weak link don think true bypass either cool cat has metal enclosure true bypass sturdier inputs knobs much better off switch features sound same spend extra will much more bullet proof pedal cool cat trem money no complaints enclosure dials footswitch all durable true bypass none boss pedals doesn suck tone pedal isn end all be all overdrive asymmetrical clipping fills niche ts pedals don lose little low end when engaged actually works pretty well leads especially humbuckers or amps looser kind classic distortion encountered el84s stand alone overdrive prefer other pedals where pedal really works me boost other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp get singing harmonic leads when dialed right like any overdrive introduce noise when pedal engaged things can get hissy while palm muting if crank too far am dirtbox hoarder like rotate pedals try different combinations lately am running into either v1 cool cat transparent overdrive timmy clone very very nice or behringer bo which dead ringer boss blues driver then into tube amp dialed mild crunch jet city combo or palomino combo any overdrive thing will sound very good imho running into solid state amp just what was intended do was intended drive preamp tubes into saturation ymmv because m cheapskate because these things durable like bricks bought used well worth new asking price very good ts type pedal at great price ability adjust treb bass nice enclosure metal knobs feel sturdy switch has durable feel an analog pedal an only digitech pedal ve ever contemplated keeping ordered pedal through amazon had few days ultimately sent back because was redundant arsenal if don ts type pedal good cheap choice personally didn think sounded any better or worse than other ts type pedals behringer to800 joyo vintage overdrive deltalab ts808 ts7 indicated tubescreamer sound well covered lol opted instead dano cool cat transparent overdrive am very happy if don ts type overdrive thinking about dropping bunch cash ts808 may want check out first comes capacitor so bonus these pots cts nice tight feel compared alpha pots alpha little cheaper basically same tolerance slightly looser feel turn get job done pretty much same what really boils down whether prefer slightly tighter feel or slightly looser turning knob what more can ask pedal runs twelve clams ships free highest quality pedal terms construction or tones gets job done nicely cheap if just starting experement stomp boxes or addicted collecting stompboxes like yours truely can go wrong fab line find placement knobs just slightly annoying nitpick at price point if looking something like boss ds will pretty much cover bases at less than quarter price boss pedal if looking more light breakup kind box cheap get dano overdrive instead silver one also find about ten bucks more behringer makes some great clone pedals great slap echo sound do buy expectation will act like digital delay closer reverb provides an echo sound similar if were playing room covered tile an old engineering trick great old school rock roll rockabilly chicken pickin etc will fatten up sound dry amp all fab pedals find knob placement slightly annoying at price point can really make justifiable complaint construction quality somewhat cheap knobs feel solid has failed me more than year yes pedal plastic switch most durable feeling knob placement annoying at less than need be able look past these things ve had higher failure rate dunlop cry baby thing built like cinder block pedal actually sounds pretty good when used intended which say pedal does nice job overdriving preamp tubes your valve amplifier no brutalz here unless already good amount gain going no overdrive pedal lives up potential running into solid state even modeling amplifier just what they really intended do they end up sounding buzzy some complained about rf interference use fab pedals getting radio signals through your amp had happen pedals costing 5x price fab particularly when running long pedal chain based tone alone pedal can overdrive your tube preamp well most anything out there under check out youtube review pedal by guy goes by intheblues believe he uses drri strat pedal sounds great if did blind test between pedal an overdrive costing north may be surprised particularly if your other gear amp halfway decent what did note though was pedal has wee bit more gain little less treble than other ts type pedals doesn make worse or better just different mid hump actually less pronounced than tubescreamer which good thing imho there already enough tubescreamer clones market will perform miracles lousy sounding guitars amplifiers incidentally pedal plays well other dirt boxes since isn true bypass will likely get some tone suck if run bunch these your chain if rest your pedals decent bypass will be fine lest mistake me novice fanboy no point reference review ve been playing since used vintage dirt boxes since before they were vintage overpriced am years past caring about brand all about getting good sounds from simple gear ymmv great pedal very lush usable tones think lightning crashes by band live ok was going initially give stars because following reasons plastic knobs foot switch does click very miniscule volume drop engagement actually moved pedal different spot signal chain think resolved volume issue can tell guess if too close tell then non issue then performed reality check myself looked at price again metal enclosure works like charm twenty four tax free bucks free shipping gets stars because there nothing even close at price knobs little sketchy they feel like they will break off if step them wrong sound just great little guy has been pedalboard since arrived mail may buy second one backup behringer hit home run one just great sounding pedal price an honest goodness great sounding od pedal no true bypass if your pedal train short or decent bypass your other pedals won detect any tone suck sounds good enough don mind lack true bypass picked one these up when they were being blown out cheaply at big box store who doesn need another pocket tuner throw bag right price was less than ten bucks unfortunately doesn work very well microphone inside unit simply very accurate gets ballpark just barely strike note once sharp play same note same force again says tune think korg tuner roughly same price range performs job much better scored virtually unused pre owned unit packed features there little bit learning curve if want really make use features simple plug play operation possible original thought was use unit an interface recording pc only gripe considerable unit sounds too digital me particularly chord or note starts decay fade probably would loved thing when started playing more years ago than care admit prefer genuine tube driven amp analog pedals does make me gear snob when consider low watt tube amps cheaply manufactured pedals can be had peanuts these days ve also owned tech trademark analog modeling amp bad traded still tech tri ac analog preamp great pedal keeper both modelers both sounded better ears than digital modelers just prefer analog all way around eventually gave unit away someone who has just taken up he likes fine gave stars because good way junior experement effects practice without annoying neighbors ve owned ts808 since purchased used 80s around yes great overdrive pedal has many famous users has been used many iconic recordings pair strat run into an amp verge breakup now re tone heaven plain truth there tons pedals out there now do what does they do fraction cost reissue was original by no means last word overdrives own boatload other dirt boxes while one iconic most transparent or versatile there mid hump eq pedal either sits well what playing or doesn m glad own mine don think d shell out what they charging these days reissue if am mistaken both ts9 ts7 can be modded circuit less than cents parts about minutes your time if pedal came under mark would be more deserving five stars really hate burst anyone bubble srv tone was really his fingers so yours nice features pedal cheap like capacity independently control treble bass switch actually works makes marked difference pedal bulletproof construction boss pedal quite few behringer pedals ve yet malfunction more than year an eh big muff pedal closer than dunlop fuzz face price another great tool your arsenal one thing keep mind any pedal true bypass if string bunch them together going experience dreaded tone suck if most your pedals true bypass or high quality buffered bypass will be fine great bang buck clone tech gt pedal does build quality gt controls identical sounds darn good especially pocket change they charge done gut shot comparison two pedals so can comment how close actual circuits components tm300 more than just distortion box more like preamp find does very convincing mid scooped twin type clean well decent marshall type growl find mesa be least authentic though an unpleasant distortion by any means just doesn sound like mesa imho if looking triple rec distortion there probably better dirt boxes actually same criticism tech tri ac really excellent pedal tm300 works well running into an amp because can simulate mic d cab can also be run directly into pa or mixer bypass amp completely thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well can really breath new life into mediocre practice amp or any solid state can also be stowed bag easily enough so don lug backup amp gigs find much more realistic sounding than digital modelers doesn quite replicate sound touch sensativity tube amp being pushed they haven invented yet opinion doesn replace tube amp me personally if contemplating running straight into pa because lugging your amp impractical no brainer five stars what does at price if hobbyist or weekend warrior pedal will cover bases if make your living doing live performances or if price factored into your decision making would advise pony up extra money tech product because their overall build quality much higher regards enclosure switch knobs jacks their customer service top shelf they engineered manufactured right nyc own three tech pedals previously owned their trademark amp can attest difference overall build quality between their products behringer sound wise they very very similar though do much love these inexpensive behringer pedals own close dozen them encountered single malfunction more than years folks like original ibanez tube king will love pedal sturdier construction than most behrenger other pedals housing metal knobs seem bit more solid folks talk about how bad stock tube has been experience may experement low gain jj future stock tube staying put now maybe got lucky they hand selected right one unit sounds really incredible when running into front end el84 powered tube amp sound really organic gritty great harmonics smooth sustain sounds decent nearly good going into solid state amp no suprise there still an improvement from sterile solid state tone be forewarned pedal gigantic dimension who cares so long sounds good d wanted vintage chandler butler tube driver forever now honestly don need one pedal gets me there cheap ve had one these several years has proven be cheap durable reasonably accurate own several different tuners what like about one microphone works well accurate tuning an acoustic batteries last long time if turn tuner off after use at ten dollars think no brainer perfect size price throw one every gig bag own replaced stock tubes groove tubes blues junior matched pair jjs much better tone imho sound exactly what want an el84 tubes held up very well am coming up needing complete retube palomino v32 will also be using jjs pedal lives up hype distortion wise delivers something between tubescreamer type od full distortion like crunchbox or rat checked out several youtube demonstrations before took plunge one think tone actually much better person than appeared videos more transparent organic sounding owned fulltone ocd past pedal nearly identical sounding if memory serves me correctly also own v1 dano cool cat od which an excellent ocd ish pedal one getting more action these days am running into front either palomino v32 or jet city watt combo amps set up just verge breakup pedal also plays well others am getting nice lead tones by running ts type od into front one jf really nice dirtbox just price fact can own clams or less makes no brainer those who like myself addicted dirtboxes noticed some price gouging few vendors here shop around knew build quality was decent because own joyo vintage overdrive they both built like bricks am confessed unrepentant hoarder dirtboxes like pedal lot 5th joyo pedal already own ultimate drive vintage overdrive crunch distortion octive fuzz pedals consider joyo dano cool cat line be some best values stomp boxes these days ve already heard particulars about pedal so won go into features build quality does appear be hair shoddier than all other joyo pedals which earlier versions switch seems little less heavy duty case seems be thinner metal said case still metal isn going fail any way switch well we will wait see or so m going complain soundwise product offers excellent gain price level particularly suited pantera can do modern mid gain up metallica without any problems an overdrive so doesn do just verge breakup thing like tubescreamer does what was designed do run into cleanish tube amp sounds very good ve also boosted following good result sd pickup booster cool cat transparent overdrive tubescreamer ts9 joyo vintage od behringer to800 tech comptortion if play rock hard rock through single channel amp like blues jr valve jr or pro jr want make two channel amp will get there most people compare pedal suhr riot do own pedal so can fairly make comparison seen several videos comparing two far concerned hear enough similarity am compelled shell out riot another comparison gets made us dream close proco rat own an original 80s rat don think they all similar us dream has tighter low end more treble better or worse just different enough they don completely cover same sonic territory don own newer rat maybe one closer us dream what they charging another home run joyo am fan joyo own vintage od ultimate drive sweet baby us dream crunchbox clone one probably least favorite joyo pedal m giving stars fuzz delivers cheap octive leaves much be desired read there simple mod will correct octive issue apparently one components installed reversed positon which results lackluster octive haven taken mine apart fix read just unsolder flip resolder same component can google better instructions still ain bad pocket change they charge reason haven fixed yet feeling once mod will sound just like dano french toast albiet sturdier case true bypass thing incredibly cool double record time closest competitor tc ditto about twenty bucks cheaper your loop can be long minutes unlimited over dubbing pedal sold out about day most big retailers likely due pre order obligations delayed release was worth wait can add layer after layer sound build wall music really cool tool jamming performing or composing operation simple press once record press again begins playback press third time dub top your last layer if make mistake press hold will erase your last dub tap twice stop play loop press hold while stopped will erase whole thing switch soft switch so there no click very responsive pressure there single knob control volume loop nicely done digitech
19	 everyone who plays flat picking m sure all your own choice pick do even remember why picked style use somehow started out fender thins here remain stated about some other strings purchased here these d addarios electric give me sound service price point need needed volume pedal smaller stature pedal case one fits bill heavy duty accurate has real smooth fall off like simple straps without too much glitz yet wide enough shoulder attractive yet simple ve written here before would be nice find multi pedal arrangement space saving still end up looking at individual pedals their individual sounds much say wanted fended tweed strap exact item sights thanks does what meant do now can use clean channel amp pedal acoustic leaves channel other pedals electric rubber can slip under strings into sound hole little effort might even be over engineered fits so well d rather use solo combo pedal save space find myself shopping separate pedals satisfy taste these new style pick me thought d give try ok probably didn try long enough so only rate three stars because opinion seller did fail me any way should researched little bit more was gift child child couldn tune thing nor could was toy an instrument think fifth behringer pedal admittedly haven had time try one out based others d say will do everything pedals cost double or more can do much say about plain leather strap except what wanted serves me well fender strapped sure wish could afford fender twin reverb old spring reverb don funds don back lug one those around anymore so baby boom does trick close enough needs ve heard about snark tuners before seen them once awhile while skimming music side amazon finally picked up works great wanted delay pedal m playing big money so had watch spent read reviews lower dollar pedals decided rogue haven had much time really play trying out has been fun expect will do job me
20	 great pedal picked up used they can be had cheaply used market actually use both an acoustic electric get little distortion bass some grit eq pots front panel make very versatile enough use cigar box also pedal can preserve bass signal still be eq d saturated distortion other reviews speak pedal both here other sites one can see why so popular also other boss distortion pedals like most people own ds an md which both cheap effective own hm heavy metal which caters more traditional metal sound actually think pedal more versatile imo different guitars where may want strictly metal tone also own an older hm heavy metal which will run circles around metal zone classic thrash speed metal tones almost any other heavy distortion pedal could never part overall like pedal cannot top older legendary boss pedals bought pedal used used both fender tube amp marshall solid state using clean channels can get variety tones from different guitars reccomend first overdrive or add collection while several overdrive pedals one good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping amps low end can get decent tones from telecaster les psul by keeping level tone knobs below o clock adjusting drive taste od sounds great through fender clean tubes also tried bass some adjustment tone drive knob bass has an overdriven tone good drive other reviews here prove pedal typical iconic boss build quality find boss pedals good their purpose mostly modded ones ve owned after some time may keep one use boost these pedals last forever only paid mine bought eq pedal use amp project replaced speaker needed some mids so bought pedal use clean channel eq boost works great being plastic box seen f c be called pure gold plastic box telecaster forum read reviews all over net saying same thing eq works wonders tone priced less than mxr boss counterparts am going rehash all other reviews use bass amp works surprisingly well old amp passive bass boost combined low bass eq works wonders low end use boss ge eq pedal different amp f c works well boss long don mind cheap construction from danelectro do gig pedal so plastic doesn matter me am wondering how long switch will last though at price who can be critical some danelectro pedals can be sorted into novelty realm one actually very functional can open up all new sounds also tried eq telecaster pedal gave me alot more bass low end hope lasts long old all plastic fab distortion bought used built cbg recently decided go these strings suggested several websites sound get from ad g strings sound great wit piezo pickup tube amp strings seem hold up well cannot comment how well they hold tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows keeping them tone parts like round head bolts nut an eye bolt bridge can be an uphill battle these strings sound great was thinking stringing electric acoustic them also compare two styles playing review par all others concerning quality cable compared cheaper ones bought locally been happy using few bass guitars cable solid definately seems hold up after few weeks heavy usage one complaint right angle does lock into jack spector bass securely works others flawlessly use jazz bass all time there no issues also use spectraflex fatso flex cables mogami think one worth price me warranty worth because price reead all over web about opinions monster patents marketing techniques written by musicians can see their points about price build quality there more expensive cables out there made by mogami countless others which any better than one opinion bought these strings after they were suggested by customer at local shop play cigar box stay uncoated strings get traditional sound from piezo pickup first set am impressed these most flexible strings another reviewer mentioned seem work well three string chords sound good through both tube acoustic amp would purchase these again needs previously used ernie ball earthwoods which were more flexible light form great also would be toss up me between two do know these sound alot better than basic matin sp strings tried previously read good reviews about these strings mylespaul com around web bought set locally same price usually use dr tite fits these made me change good they lot mids bass make great chunky blues classic rock sound p90 also used set single coil stray cigar box built they give lot resonance life old box cheapo pickup will buy another set dr strings never disappoint bought these through amazon about year ago installed them all guitars both nickel black heavy basses they never let me down since installed them an electric acoustic out convenience purpose locks work great give an added sense security reviews locks speak themselves no matter what style whether les paul strat or active bass would strongly suggest them never used dunlop locks heard some epiphone gibson les pauls mounting holes more suited dunlops one thing note all these come their own longer screws use if needed never had use them they nice touch ended up parts bin herco jim dunlop company little humidifier was suggested me through someone who has used them awhile dunlop trusted brand maintenance most part wanted stay away from typical humidifiers due their tendencies leak stain wood used few weeks now still remians moist product came fast instructions straight forward may order another if one performs well bought wax compared meguiars ve been using years surpasses meguiars by miles few guitars they really shine wax can really see depth paint wax works great headstocks also like applicator fact paste wax which effortless apply along few high end guitars also few beaters used wax an old squier thoroughly used looks fantastic fine scratches blems gone looks great use old shirts buff wax off guitars found comes off chrome easilly overdid an older les paul was surprised see wax come off ease will buy stuff again again local shop sells same price bought use an older acoustic neck which was bit faded after uses wood looks great again used honey twice days brought back maple wood like new condition honey works fast well will make playing fingerboard alot easier saw local shop same price minus shipping after bought do use much so should last long time originally bought pedal boost an old amplifier signal works suprisingly well wanted boost which didn color tone has worked well needs price good bought locally same price here since bought pedal upgraded speaker old amp still use boost speaker use pedals tone transparent boosting pedal output great use distortion overdrive good results found new uses pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting front them all all besides good eq pedal boost effective worth every penny cable works me tuner out jack amp noticed how thin cable length good needs played through cable once found sub par compared other cables which professional grade cost lot more cheap cable sounds like any other cable caliber use right angle hook up jazz bass during rehearsal where long cables at times bunch up become cumbersome studio setting found price amazon cheaper than local shop quickly bought slide works smoother than brass slide an acoustic electric also sounds great cigar box piezo pickup slide thick large size fits well middle ring pinky finger found tone both guitars brighter more defined using slide compared brass slide which suits an electric better imo tried ceramic slide any dunlop ceramic slide most likely future purchase jim dunlop products solid last long most part their slides seem be most popular brand aside boutique bottle slides think one will last long time bought using prime am happy power supply many different makes power supplies end they all same proof lies boss unit owned years amazon had planet waves 9v supply lowest price lower than local retailers if do use or need spot will let down may order more use some older pedals board ordered after saw one squier bass at local shop plate looks great mim fender telecaster thicker nicer than fender f plate see other guitars used screws was an easy install other reviewers posted about finish thickness plate plate has five screw holes doesn look bad using just visual mod me mainly get rid crappy cheap plate which used mim telecaster planet waves has built its company making affordably priced accessories these patch cables no exception bought these at local center about same price thickness connectors seems hold up well although may look slimmer alternative soon some other reviewers stated also connector ends bit large could become difficult work smaller or crowded pedalboards bought pedal wanting classic distortion find more useful an overdrive pedal distortion range does get hot rat or mxr classic distortion sounds great telecaster tube amp use cigar box also fun tone ranges from distortion metal get more extreme distortion from old hissing boss mega distion an example like pedal has wide array uses build quality seems questionable from mxr others posted box very light knobs seem thinner than other mxr espeacially older ones pedal seems solid makes no noise price demo videos were primary reason bought pedal am happy many distortion pedals each one useful their own way would steer clear if looking pedal metal definately buy if into classic rock twang blues

fine our uses overall good value low cost unit little amp exactly what son needed his acoustic output while playing outside porch amp produces much bigger sound much better quality than expected does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an ac power adapter when he uses houses we also like has headphone jack which cuts sound speaker when plugged highly recommend note we burgundy color one cfh onstage heavy duty stand exactly what we were looking hold son acoustic here observations easy setup takes just few seconds sturdy free standing design works well neck retainer adds degree protection

51	 hums crackles think m having problems equipment soon use any other cords then problem gone hosa makes some other products good value based experience don recommend one was getting errors printer cartridge wasn recognized sprayed some contacts wiped off excess paper towel now working pay couple bucks more get one from brand like audio technica know going withstand test time mine working fairly well attachments loosening so who knows what next no complaints attaches firmly does job can beat price order eyes closed great deal might work well recording too when take output jack speaker acceptable quality can be compared fender amp one has watts small speaker other has watts m opting convenience size got after getting couple smaller amps headphone monitor plugs since has both was better sound good effects like brit setting sound like rock star good product practice or recording could get away microphone amplify gig around same price could get fender amp product works me quality pretty good other mini amps similar accessories toys compared tone control didn work so was returned was pretty nice even though felt fret board quality higher gibson les paul what can expect if had order again would pay more get sg which has quality pickups sound let say average good beginner or can be upgraded new pickups bolt neck didn bother me sg doesn which another reason would step up next time shape ok purely subjective like solid les paul shape now little better since more conservative size good almost more comfortable than les paul style can believe they can make good like only bucks also even though was tempted faded finish glossy finish really nice will make player proud sent back probably due ignorance has multiple patterns collect sound was clear mike didn detect any body sound maybe preamp would helped checked out many mikes ended up rode nt 1a which probably similar character goal was record voice without color came close wonder how could zillion ratings five stars suspicious ratings me now more experience would be curious check out since found good solution don think worth effort toy well crafted instrument material wood decent quality plain wood nice tone colors good refinements rings around hole stripe back strings had some oxidation understandable was made shipped from indonesia metal strings so consideration if re beginner sounds good too prefer sound metal anyway so if re beginner or an intermediate player who just needs nice instrument hanging around home an occasional strum pleasant addition home guitars wife who learning she loves costs what mine costs don mind playing at all only plastic plate front protects during strumming don even feel good highly recommended occasional strummer works great didn use monster size wall board screw holds fine small furnished screws next time m buying all metal one daisy chaining them board so don make tons holes wall half dozen guitars now m hanging one wall fine wood nice quality notice price almost 2x much if walk center bought pedals works great doesn cost much just attached an existing adapter voila great desktop vocals also used successfully cabinet an important component studio quality sound much more than transistor radio there slight hiss too enjoyed listening while playing when attach headphones works great amazine works off 9v battery yes lug around cord what do expect went all out got roland cube which should deliver higher quality sound has many sound effects costs 2x or more much am process returning look at picture next coke can what looks like some people complained handle doesn work who cares tweed speaker looks like toy too sort what re getting works great same effect alesis midi keyboard do more expensive yamaha keyboard which has sustain pedal chrome great quality has good weight so tinny good quality doesn cost very much price great too glad bought folds up well has black finish works great doesn cost an arm leg quality good holds microphone confidence great price too much better than more economical one sold should gotten foot live learn studio small needs wrap around desk go into sound proof closet matches awesome at2035 microphone was using box great help stomach doesn feel wrenched anymore use right leg right leg maybe conventional classic position works me seems work well like other reviewers said could probably pay more get same thing solid construction getting used attachment will never stand position like photo there no resistance joint so flops down just place upside down record using headset or ll get too much feedback just ordered shorter stand hope works joint makes stand head down works well can detect tones from electric input or acoustically find myself using lot even learn notes fret board if guess incorrectly reminds me note also use intonate has some other advanced features haven need them display nice large even though still need reading glasses see note couple guitars bass hooked at same time attaches audio interface no cable switching didn need sophistication other mixers costing 5x much fast convenient way switch guitars while recording compared c1 which pretty good half price also tried two mxls one v63 much better hands down even if costs 2x much noticed difference vocal picks up fair amount noice around realized normal other mike just didn pick stuff up which worse mxl v67g sounded warm vocals too bad if got too close gave fake low voice just like taking at2035 signal modifying after ve recorded besides bright green gold was little too much me tried cad m179 did better treble side seemed miss mids heard at2020 wasn good at2035 so went more than switches difference which don use anyway didn like switches cad m179 either confusing do gain or filter daw considered nt at bucks more than seemed like they were very similar at end m satisfied work horse costs fraction more popular studio amps only subtle difference me been staying away from at products because didn like headphones compared sony time caved because don see anything competes at price range me works like an sm57 microphone costs about same can record acoustic or electric out cab or sing challenge get record echo room ve removed door closet put shower curtain down comforter record there ridiculous setup ve save hundreds insulation costs hours doing most vocals recording don use closet just use refir some recording tricks remove any unwanted noise so if things don change choice best vocal instrument microphone price range nice solid construction vibration mount included rugged like bucks better than tube screamer from ibanez sound very similar based youtube use clean channel bugera v22 tube amp makes guitars sound like they should awesome ltd vc jb pickups sounds crisp had alesis io2 express which did similar job after hearing subtle difference youtube video finally broke down heard more definition now take quality granted has higher quality dials feel solid little limiter lamp awesome m very happy even if old alesis was doing job old alesis had midi pass through which didn work anyway so feature feature better pick even if around bucks more leather type material corrosive free button type attachment strap would prefer so wide include button button snap just lack word describe previously used use shoe lace would be thinking about falling while playing now more confidence strap gucci doesn feel like plastic either

56	 use cord church run from pedalboard amp which soundproof box cord reliable clean sounding like used hosa products past confidence excellent cord hopefully review will be usefull ve been using elixers godin multiac steel sa many years now they great too bright sound don get string noise when move your hands across neck like do traditional strings these tend last me about months so am very happy them they also track pretty well roland synth so no gripes there all all really like these strings think they sound great used d addario strings years gibson les paul they sound great had stint where tried coated strings paul they just didn ringing bright tone d addarios ve never been one strings break me often guess just don play heavy handed many friends who do who still use these find them very reliable they comparible tone dean markely slinky imho very much recommend these strings anyone who plays electric all styles used them rock country jazz fusion christian contemporary gigs very dependable set usually lasts me couple shows before change them out like any string they will lose brightness after couple gigs strings claiming last longer than tone opinion usually somewhat lifeless begin anyway these great threads ole geetar if never used them should try them out good stuff use pedal mainly church setting ambient volume swells has seven different reverbs can choose from including reverse so will definitely suit your needs whatever require reverb ruggedly built digital which some will like others won like said taken liking other digitech pedals well they sound good affordable digitech main squeeze an okay compression pedal do use yes however would likely trade an mxr or dunlop if had opportunity doesn sound bad per se does some hiss also boosts your signal noticeable volume increase while some may like want compressor be little more subtle just provide some added sustain own one spot ran out plugs all pedals product allowed me lengthen cord provide added power supply needed no tone loss at all great an extension rather than having get another power supply these great strings such rare instrument many people play baritone yuke has unique quality sort like miniature classical these strings sound full warm instrument use these patch cables pedal board they save valuable space they work well haven had any problems any them shorting out or making static or other noises highly recommend them plus they look nice unlike various colors come bulkier cheaper cords schaller strap locks keep your place they been around long time hold up well time also used dunlops which nice well these seem be better product imho alpha great little interface accepts inputs outputs going into your computer powered via usb mix knob nice feature allowing hear your input more or less prominently within playback mix without affecting input daw m using cakewalk music creator touch so didn bother load le software came like cakewalk software better anyways just preference some reviewers commented hearing hiss from unit while recording haven had problem extremely silent save any noise would generate anyway from rig all all feel great product definitely worth money son daughter love playing mic stand comes cord has standard inch end plugged into small amp they use mainly sing along their cds mp3 note really mic would use studio more toy be honest quality toy young child regard give five stars simple review here good strings help create good sound these nice strings quality instrument stay tune well they overly bright nor dark rather nice round sound them highly recommend take medication makes hands shake therefore difficult time fine muscle movements switched from dunlop jazz iii which loved these puppies because they great feel them don worry about dropping them they also bigger than jazz iii making bit easier hold first all strap looks super cool hootenany style sweeeet cream colored strat like looks great reason only four stars material bit thin hey price am expecting levy strap all all great strap throw some strap locks away go zt lunchbox some sort new technology allows loud good sounding tone come through box literal size lunchbox was amazed at how small amp was when first purchased tiny then was amazed at how loud could be still clean headroom others reviewed written about hissing sound had problem after trying guitars passive p u active p u acoustic electric remains nice quiet been using practice amp well band setting now here thing does lot bass frequency noticed setting floor does help some still enough if re looking heavy metal scooped sound so would recommend metal heads out there however all jazzers rockers tone knob makes big difference keep tone at about 9o clock setting because prefer little darker sound has enough mids cut through mix nicely still bottom line would recommend amp obviously gave stars don think will be dissappointed there ton reviews here don lot add can read about what tuner does does do specs section or from other reviewers who tend review specs instead how they like or dislike something bottom line favorite headstock tuner also own new ns mini has its own qualities like well like being small doesn fit godin headstock tuner snark fits godin small headstock no problems dark stage works great love little tuner five stars purchased pedal recently bit skeptical such low price tag however was completely impressed don use tremolo effect often when do just need some subtle shimmering swells box does trick construction wise housed an all metal chasis knobs feel sturdy enough button seems strong by way true bypass which nice doesn seem affect tone when kick no volume or tone changes just tremolo effect silly enough yellow paint looks cool pedal board don know if will purchase other joyo effects am impressed one stars these strings snappier feel louder volume amplified than regular nickel steel strings cobalt different material making strings supposed higher output longer life recently ordered new m steels from ernie ball try them out they supposed even more cobalt even better output use p90 single coils godin lg these strings sound great they nice feel them can bend heck out them no breaking no problems slipping tuning m hoping m steels will be even better if these vast improvement over regular strings was using which were ernie ball regular slinky made from nickel we got young son who enjoys reading his bed prior going sleep at night he really likes light bright enough him read by too bright hurts his eyes good buy could see where could be useful other applications like music stand also makes great reading lamp attached bed am newbie world playing blues harp however am beginner music played fervently past years so knew little something when thought would try learn harmonica technique utmost importance found learning how pucker tongue block instrument was effortless sounds most part tune its tone great kids love hear me play however there con wonderful instrument after owning several days draw hole went flat researched found poor technique would likely be culprit so worked technique some more dismay one note harmonica allows bend into other tones considered sweet spot instrument did work right obviously cannot take back seller really his her fault am sure how repair feel should do so early game maybe naivete hoping perfect instrument so took one star away because problematic issue otherwise really like harmonica ns ned steinburger capo different than your traditional kyser style capo really like how designed where conforms neck nicely feels more part than other capos used boasts minimal string bending across frets where will stay tune better up down neck tried out sure enough their claim was true capo ed from 1st fret up 10th where would actually never use tuning stayed pretty much accurate there also nice slot capo put an extra pick just case drop one your hand overall great product give high recommendation five stars flashback x4 an awesome sounding flexible delay pedal got through third party seller amazon under new steal opinion having three settings awesome since will use them all set having tap tempo must one works perfectly toneprints cool choose from if find something enjoy website simple use galaxy beam toneprint into pedal from pickups very cool technology makes me feel like m version star trek can say favorite delay type since they all sound so great am partial modulation very clean very cool sounding without having too much chorus space setting also very cool has hint tremelo background which coincides delay time sounds great little overdrive added all all great pedal purchase am totally happy by far best delay pedal ever owned well being most versatile five stars from me tascam dp 008ex great love little box got lot features packed into small unit about half size your average laptop here few features really like about portable runs 4aa batteries has compression exciter de esser well eq reverb has mastering section effects can record tracks then bounce them free up more tracks feels sturdy would drop just name few compared against fostex mr8mkii which also own like tascam has more features buck well should just came out year fostex has been around while another reviewer put won replace your daw can record some very polished songs laptop tascam does come close mics front great feature sound pretty good too recorded few songs already found be very enjoyable experience portability factor huge opinion being able take downstairs when kids upstairs or vice versa great plus fun record vocals bathroom kitchen areas totally recommend any songwriter who wants nice scratchpad put down ideas quick creative manner then polish them up bit mastering section five stars tascam th headphones like putting pair studio monitors your ears they great excellent bass response muddy at all tight mids clear highs boot they extremely comfortable well foam fits nicely around your ears conforming contours your face they adjustable so if huge head can still wear these only drawback can see don really even consider negative coiled cord some people may like all all these great headphones listened all varieties music them monitored recordings them etc excellent by way they also pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise background making music come out clearer kudos tascam making such good headphones may update these headphones quit working after just few months working properly couple pair inexpensive behringers lasted through more abuse still working what disappointment am fan planet waves ns capos new one very well designed way sits sort backwards find left hand hitting lever when m open position frustrating does pick holder which can be handy place put an ns tuner which can also be handy just think could been better designed don particularly care capo will likely use much stuff ll stick other ns planet waves capo or old faithful kyser apogee jam works great sounds great operation very simple plug your plug your mac or ios device mine hooked up macbook running garage band if there any latency can hear works beautifully apogee known making good music products jam no exception was able plug microphone line level into well record vocals likewise worked well string bass well was able record whole song no time simple audio interface affordable dependable ve used elixirs about five years now set offers same great sound acoustic their electric strings provide electric some people don like polymer nanoweb coats string find cuts back string noise sliding your fingers around doesn cause too much noise acoustic strings find very important especially if re using piezo pickup your instrument phosphor bronze has always been great alloy acoustic guitars imho these great strings worth money sound great they also last times longer than regular non coated strings experience been playing 24yrs great product

58	 works practice instrument cable what can say maybe best serves purpose build quality could be better ideally nut needs be replaced cut rush job neck needs be reset there gap indicates pocket wasn completely cleaned out when was put what do expect price however playable instrument right out box if re willing invest another or so can be great starter young smaller player or nice travel instrument been using these years acoustic like them never an issue nice bright tone last good long while ve got three these hold an acoustic mini strat jazzmaster while had no doubts about their capacity hold former was somewhat leary about later quite bit heavier than other two after putting some weight coming apart been trusting do fix these directly into drywall screws provided though they seem awfully small weight full size electric doubts about those plugs hanger will hold drywall might get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated at least weight your instrument used different setup philips slotted round heads would actually been better fix them nice piece x x pine screwed into studs some screws needless say going anywhere bonus scheme even acoustic hangs free wall ok one month later nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even something heavy jazzmaster satisfies needs nice cloth covered large strain relied good plugs put bit thread lock them they unscrew almost unintentionally like even if bit long use at home

70	 very recently bought young daughter based previous reviews she joined jazz band at her school since she smaller than average year old she needed smaller sized was packaged very well took while just get out packaging only thing found so far sort disappointed me was there were some dark stain blemishes white pick guard trying get stains off damp paper towel didn work so took special soft damp sponge made remove stains gently rubbed over spots they came off finish plastic pick guard dulled where had rubbed stains off sort irked me however didn seem bother daughter nearly much did me despite blemish episode fits her perfectly tried tune using clamp snark tuner didn work at all some reason so we went center bought an electric tuner which plug cord into from really worked well tune tuning pegs gears were stiff bit hard turn when change strings will adjust them make them easier turn strings comes very cheap so ll need change those out soon much better set they ll do now plugged old crate amp sounded pretty good knobs front turn well an did what they supposed do easy control tone volume from without having dicker much amp daughter had great time getting used she great classical guitarist teach classical so playing an electric was new experience her old strat just too big heavy her black one looks good despite dullness only can see her she was awesome playing jazz her school concert other night since so inexpensive just right smaller person really can find anything major wrong say about m glad bought just wish didn come stains feels solid well constructed very heavy like playing too ve ordered really good gig bag new cord pignose amp just her course bunch new electric strings she ll find small stuff her stocking christmas can wait us do some mother daughter electric duets play teach classical needed good digital recorder which record myself students also be able convert mp3 format upload internet ve recorded several solo pieces does pick up very well including all string squeaks fret buzzes darn so will force clean up your playing bit if musician want recorder very portable relatively easy use then little gadget quite good won give recording studio quality can clearly hear deep tones classical no hiss or background noise unless big mouthed birds like do so re recording very clear when get ready record set gain described manual then set recorder music stand begin playing since bought 4g card can play piece many times need too row without worrying about running out memory just finally play piece specifications also if connect h2 an electrical outlet rely batteries one less worry your h2 won die during recording because batteries give out can really tell any difference recording quality or without wind sock came sounds same guess if were singer would use screen out wind doesn really need yes screen very small difficult read keep magnifying glass handy now ve pretty much got button pushing sequences memorized don need use often see screen also download free editing program such audacity so can convert your recordings various formats d give stars if case was little more substantial seems fragile dropped once luckily bounced off foot which had big fuzzy house shoe so didn break might if had broken fall will need longer usb cord can believe one they sent was so short very easy fix overall one nice little tool price d buy again update 12i m still using h2 zoom almost daily basis record students playing own playing still love works great feel really purchased great item only used tuner classical guitars ones nylon strings teach classical had opportunity use many different classical guitars varying quality has tuned them all very well great advantage ve found using tuner tune tech tt500 verses tuners which use microphone can now talk students while tuning no longer ask them please be quiet while tune their guitars kids especially like talk now can fully engage conversation them while tuning their guitars only problem ve noticed thus only stars usually begin tuning any string other than low e string some reason tuner seems trouble sensing low e vibrations needle will move problem has always resolved itself when tune another string then tune low e pros pitch registered quickly minimal needle fluctuations2 ambient noise does disturb tuning sensor3 small compact4 swivel head ease viewing screen screen very bright also easily seen direct sunlight rubber feet clamp will scratch guitar7 clamp strong will open wide easy squeeze open fingers being chromatic tuner means stuck just tuning eadgbe tuning range note a2 b7 will automatically turn itself off after minutes non use cons delay tuning low e string2 buttons rattle while tuning 2nd string b plastic screen scratches easilyi don yet know how long button battery will last or how much battery replacements cost will update review when information now am very pleased tuner owned many electronic tuners one so far beats them all also used tune guitarlele tunes darn near perfectly great chromatic tuner at great price love there really nothing can add what already been said about tuner teach classical one students came tuner took look at knew had one too tuner will tune chromatically so don need buy special tuner can use well guitarlele which tuned 4th higher than chose over other chromatic tuner night daughter was play her school talent show needed be able tune her accurately quickly despite all noise large room performed fantastically so did she soft rubbery feeling won scratch your reading easy read red light re flat green re pitch yellow ve gone sharp reads almost instantly other chromatic clip tuner had some trouble d low e strings tuner seems give me pitch quickly like tuner lot highly recommend bought snark tuner daughter use tuner her classical her guitarlele ve been using blue snark tuner couple years loved thought she needed snark her own works like charm like chromatic aspect because can tune your strings any pitch other than concert pitch sometimes we like go lower sometime whole or half step higher beautiful look at clips head instrument soft rubber feet truly does an excellent job tuning teach classical found tuner be one go most lot different tuners rarely use any other tuners anymore relying mostly snarks uses cr2032 button battery which inexpensive lasts long time use snark at least times day either tuning instruments or students what really love about these types tuners can talk while tuning since feels vibrations string instead listening will tune practically anywhere loud rooms etc tune accurately

them typically these or beefy scale guitars all cases has brought smaller guitars from duds nice playing instruments three radical samples come mind an old gibson l1 pulled bridge out an sx traveler could hear low e until got rid lil martin lower bout started delam under pressure bridge pull short scale acoustic guitars someplace between full size acoustic ukulele most cases set up heavier gauge strings even though manufacturers insist delivering them way due their short scales small frets light construction if can hear low e or having problems fretting your strings try these what can hurt get speaker separate drive control volume amp try findthose two capabilities another amp around by far best practice amp found past years owna butt load new amps actually upgraded champion still use amp much don even think about one best under practice amps unless looking gadget filled amp case should look elsewhere one forturning going fiddling around digital controls until havejust lost most your practice time an addendum would like add should probably try replace speakeras read from other reviewers few these amps so just heck put celestion g10 greenback which costs more than 25r was very disappointed withthe results amp being carried by lot retailers now can still be had new under if just do an internet search seven these use ibanez am73 they perfect anyam series guitars like bag well padded expensive seems always back order which tells me they very popular dimensions l w at bout deep has two large zippers head zipper goes all wayaround bout zipper stops before entering bottom area which only draw back thisgig bag all deeper guitars want bottom bout zipper at least complete bottom areato make placing removing easier best gig bag found last few years smaller bout guitars does cost too much both fender g dec line spider jam just blows them away controls much more intuitive than g dec line like hitting level buttonto bring drum beat volume down so could hear over was able immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks or drum beats wanted only time had lookin manual was figure out how change tempo which very easy only mention these capabilities compare fender line once go further into amp get into dubbing recording takes bit moreeffort proper foot pedal amp can get really loud don see why could use gig long asthe venue no larger than standard bar or side show since only had amp short time can say anything about how will holdup other amps by different companies quality just fine by way g dec sale addendum following take between jam series do wish modeling amp will literally model existing amps artists songs from different years spider does board song or drum loops like spider jam if trying get specific sound band or musician or place time then isyour amp if need practice amp go jam both amps far am concerned jam far better modeling amp does what spider does plus drum song tracks can play along plus whole lot more even if based spider technology jm4 looper its engine while spider nice amp very specific user needs isnot flexible do agree both amps worthless without foot pedals used jam longtime without only acquired express pedal when ordered spider also be very aware line documentation their amps very very lacking put mildly there so called line videos user groups just lacking their documentation these great picks yes they slippery reason material method manufacturing delflex polymer picks injection molded blend acetyl making them extremely durable bright sounding unlike stamped picks which manufactured from sheet film can different feel when rotated injection molded picks same flexibility all directions these probably brightest sounding picks ever used well worth gettingused hanging them use 61mm solid body electrics 76mm semi hollow bodies 04mm bass right use plectrum bass can get pick easier hang may give away some bright snap softer hang material like nylon lot guitars do all work them myself couple secrets installing mike pickup after drill hole trying figure out just how get thejack into place from inside do get patch cable run through hole just drilled until can grab throughthe sound hole jack into axl then pull out hole using your cable may dothis couple times get jam nuts set right depth so having way make processeasier big help also did use giant endpin collar came assy just takesup lot thread space accomplish nothing finding sweet spot smaller guitars ukulele mandolin can be close impossible because soundhole actually so small can get your hand finger length far can go so most cases go direction low e string side what typically lacking smaller instruments unless jimi hendrix hands case congratulations finally travel guitars get rid giant strings come some these things sx traveller came could even hear low e string had an old set electric took off bb king lucille just heck swapped them out man what difference actually so much difference really didn need axl just installed even though fun addition far an amp little honeytone has been feeling out place alongside very large amp arsenal just may found home about small can get go along travel modeling amp will literally model existing amps

sky high am professional drummer serious envy all can say goodby jack tuners little baby makes no difference whether playing an electric bass or an acoustic can tune fly thing clipped your headstock all time admittedly can do jack tuner without jack part results aren always good fish around tuner whole turn amp down unplug from amp jack into tuner unplug from tuner plug back into amp turn amp up process every time something sounded bit off always soured me brought down enthusiasm while practicing playing those days over need keep enthusiasm level high actually play instead fishing around tuner far accuracy good or better than any jack tuner three different brands use amp shop when testing out new configurations pickups flyand then if sounds ok go big boys blues room amp will reach its max short order again what price ishard find an equal these dual amplified speaker cabinets something new me am used normal dual cabinet one amplified set up like behringer ms16 which was trying replace these second thought will set them up someplace else they do front controls only one trs or xlr connection point require ac power both p frary has stated very dependent input they kind worked stanton s300 at all laptop they stated by other reviewers very subtle may take some getting used because dual amps don hear sound travel from cabinet cabinet each speaker cabinet stand alone unit actually hooked one up like amp worked fine just little amp sounded great your normal stereo mini jack rca hook ups would go much lower priced ms16 which multiple rca jack points one stereo mini full

89	 own lots hosa cables they cheap quality there ve only recieved one bad cable out around or so use lot these guys if they work when get them they havn failed yet own mobile dj company ultimate ts stands m really happy them product simple does job well priced they little heavy at lbs per stand like look operation them ve been happy them so far title says all didn like ac adaptor did work very well was strong liked how solid was these headphones wonderful wear they sound great enough now days head band being connected outside muff they fit your head so wide pioneer hdj has look read review those though they terrible at first glance these things serious pro grade they made very durable components both ears swivel they fit snug head head band isn bad plastic material notice when stretch see how flexible pad top head starts come unglued really big concern though they long cord ll talk more about later ends spin or standard 5mm sound out these things pristine muddy very clear they good amount bass because over ear style they drown lot background noise out they also don leak noise like lot headphones do pros heavy duty awesome sound comfortable headband over ear design worried about breaking when through them bag always clear never muddy even at high volumes very clear left right ear markings spin plugcons heavy coil cord heavy weight never got annoying though looks
90	 decent cable does its job leaves much be desired far structural integrity concerned mating part connector jiggles back forth switch also loose connector will move around 2mm out microphone without switch being pressed would recommend using cable critical applications would be more suited home or hobby use do much say about does what was designed do looks fine found myself actually trying see if will rip purposes review just so could make some sort comment about can rip if try likely happen during everyday use fairly thick if isn what want then would look elsewhere should be fine nearly everyone who doesn very specific reason different sort windscreen pyle pro pmks8 mic stand good someone looking buy budget fairly solid heavy enough hold itself down flexible enough position mic how need there few issues however metal neck difficult tighten onto its base without causing microphone be crooked means choose between having straight forward mic having mic which doesn swivel around its base mic holder has same issue would use mic stand an event where plainly visible an audience simply too difficult position look good camera would use mic stand personal voice recording an communication great desk or small recording studio great microphone light sensitive looks professional used alongside xonar dg sound card recordings sounded clear even when boosted 22db would recommend anyone looking do amateur voice recording

also spray q tip clean all jacks guitars instruments if understand what think great idea maybe perfect tool believe does what supposed does well keeping mind m player who just bought drum kit assumptions when using drum tuning relative meaning drum pitch established by ear based what want each drum sound like unlike stringed instrument which tuned against an absolute reference frequency each string has distinct relation others concept torque key assists applying equal tension each tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all way around circumference head by no means will help establish specific pitch any drum simply helps achieve an even tension relative pitch all around head tension numbers torque key reference only tighter than tighter than so yet these numbers only relevant each head find don necessarily pick number such tune all drums way use right or wrong tune an approximate tune any given head using traditional method tapping around perimeter tightening apposing rods necessary until pitch same all way around at an audible frequency like drum m tuning now theoretically re pretty well tuned anyway when grab torque key set number bit lower than were expect torque only comes from experience using few times then check tension rod increase setting torque key until no longer breaks over now whatever number m reference number drum process from here move around head same crisscross pattern would tuning traditionally loosen each rod bit first then bring back up torque torque key after process drum head should both be at pitch chosen by ear equal pitch all around drum head believe common practice use slightly different tension bottom side head ether little tighter or looser than top side typically little lower pitch bottom once ve tuned top head know what number ve used can quickly tune bottom by reducing or increasing click or two your torque key sure there few other variable can come play like did seat head adequately when installing which essence means did apply some light pressure center head while drawing down tension rods small equal amounts crisscross pattern also how rims your shells they well machined smooth these may impact ability torque based tune work how about your tension rods threads clean they lubricated any variability resistance threads your torque rods will directly translate pitch location again m just rookie may be off some these assumptions or they may an essentially unmeasurable impact so take what worth once find tuning like could write down what number took achieve pitch like each head would make easy quickly get back same pitch if when your drums need be tuned again these cables work well jam space they do seem little thin if they were be used heavily gig ing at price fair don get me wrong these good cables price am very happy d buy more sure would probalby uses these gigging well if didn heavier duty jumpers available title says these great value work well big muff pi wicker had

blend better black black pearl or tort pickguard ordered another package from another vendor got same result perhaps large factory shipment bad some very dull looking very disappointing really only complaint doesn fold up smaller otherwise an excellent stand concede m bit spoiled by super light weight much more compact folded dimensions myk m memphis pro stand however light weight comes at cost slightly more fragile build extra heft hercules has advantage slightly better stability when remove instrument from stand k m tends want bounce backward weight removed if used padded carpeted floor despite folding up quite small hercules simpler unfold adjust one action legs one action height whereas k m has three separate legs two vertical sections clamps do realize bought one without folding yoke am considering aspect when comparing k m length girth folded would still be quite bit larger than k m large enough won try carrying gig bag pocket do k m m also convinced hercules trade mark pivoting finger yoke all necessary type stand back angle fact good portion instrument rests against padded legs means would take so much force knock an instrument off knock whole stand over no big deal just more parts weight think prefer k m yoke automatically adjusts inward width neck weight applied hercules has fixed width yoke pivoting gates both work perfectly well fender similar bass head stocks ve had two k m second was bit disaster was defective more than two areas defects happen one highlighted weakness which concerns me bit lead me try hercules won go into all here see review product aside from potential weak spot yoke hercules should prove be far more durable tolerant occasional clumsiness m glad purchased one think ll get plenty use from should mention did allow me better understand appreciate strengths k m mainly its awesome portability despite its slightly more fragile nature interest further comparison ve got anultimate gs100 support genesis standon order will review against k m well opted gs without an automatic closing mechanism over gs which has one reasons stated above don believe strictly necessary reviews gs100 also more favorable gs100 cheaper which suits cheapness excellent price excellent tuner one flaw using couldn be simpler has excellent contrast would say was best clip tuner ve had chance use except broke first time carried gig bag rehearsal one little fingers holds ball socket back tuner broke off so tuner clip now separate pieces model works only by vibration unlike red one so without clip very useful possible hold against head stock still use isn very convenient would just super glue together at good angle put different positions different instruments ve seen number complaints elsewhere about same problem so would call design weakness despite negatives would buy another if they beefed up construction or sold hard protective case update added back star m still managing use after hobbling together fix involving rubber sink washer even slightly compromised mount continues provide excellent results recently purchased replacement sn b found really disappointing so much so may send back also tried planet waves mini

first state record hate strap locks hate may be bit shy mark actually ve never met set liked any single way ve only ever dropped an instrument had strap locks fact every instrument ve owned strap locks has suffered gravity attack caused by very device intended prevent such misfortune schaller type strap locks tend come unscrewed even locktite when install them compressing nut washer against compressible material leather nylon etc so never really tight plus there only about two threads slim little nut if they aren really tight match other half wear very quickly especially since tighten them so often duncan type often suffer from non positive lock syndrome if regularly cleaned lubed then there fact unless all your instruments equipped same brand lock buttons your strap only compatible ones which match then there metal metal clankyness yuck oh cost moving why these little elliptical end pins so brilliant they strap locks if orient widest points horizontally when install them should then order put your strap take off will need turn strap degrees instrument isn something likely do inadvertently while reaching your beer onstage sometimes simplest design best design they re pretty too downsides will say screws supplied these pretty short then would also argue there no reason use screws holding original strap buttons long they fit tightly if they don using smaller or shorter screws answer especially considering if screws cut new threads re pretty much uh screwed washers these come pretty small too so just used screws felt washers came factory buttons brand new strap they can be bit tricky get just tricky get off which good tight fit could cause some increased wear strap especially if made from cheap materials older straps just any traditional strap button need develop good habit always checking positive seat strap very easy verify again much less likely slip than traditional button mechanical strap locks actually require just much diligence ensure they still securely fastened working properly strap locks if there problem ll grab some tools fix or replace entirely talk about false sense security pe elliptical end pins just put strap where should be re set if one who taken doing back flips or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like hula hoop onstage then these probably won save your precious instrument from gravity goblin or inertia monkey worst intentions if either these antics your norm might be better served by permanently attached strap or perhaps therapy since writing review above ve ordered several more sets use all basses m done traditional strap buttons don imagine ever going back metal metal strap locks ve only spent few hours so far fantastic wanted simple grab go recorder songwriting sessions jams rehearsals

overdrive get some heavy heavy tones while retaining sound amp natural distortion between can dial some classic crunch tones suitable rock blues or just smooth overdrive after playing around knobs found very versatile well voiced pedal actually prefer tube screamers its clones been done death d iii conceptually same just sounds different ts doesn let go low end price fantastic buy delivers enough output be used fantastic clean boost there enough gain tap dial just about any rock tone d want save modern high gain metal first tube amp after doing ton research found vox ac15c1 was just about perfect me came down ac15 fender blues jr ibanez ts15 blues jr has somewhat small enclosure 1x12 felt had bit boxy tone otherwise great amp ibanez has classic tube screamer circuit built switch which cuts wattage half playing at lower volumes lacked reverb circuit which was deal breaker silly reasoning know ac15 has larger enclosure than blues jr has reverb tremolo circuit so had features was looking most importantly produces some killer tone if ve ever seen or read review amp chances ve heard about classic vox chime which amp has fell love natural tube saturation top boost channel right away normal channel will break up nicely too would suggest an b switch run normal channel fairly clean top boost pretty dirty was worried at first watts wouldn be enough fear amp loud maybe too loud m just hobbyist plays bedroom bad thing totally blows away watt marshall solid state haven put volume much past o clock fear wife may beat me death if do while there no effects loop takes pedals well distorted tones ve found myself just plugging straight just get unadulterated tube crunch which ve come love so much stated above lack foot switch change between clean dirty tones will be solved by either running dirt box front amp or previously stated running one channel clean one channel dirty us an b switch go between them far other effects really like what does tc electronic flashback delay corona chorus note there foot switch jack back panel controls off built tremolo reverb sadly included amp first tube amp don think could done much better love tone can get tube warmth just sooo much more soulful than sterile sound from solid state amp feature rich takes pedals well other two amps was considering were little less expensive while really feel vox just better all around amp don think can go wrong any one three weight about lbs lack an included foot switch really only two cons can think while would picked up all three amps was looking at if had means would hesitate recommend amp anyone looking their first or next tube amp purchased amp locally initially thought was pretty cool was first modeling amp lots potential limitless variety sounds was first fender amp well presets were neat all when played around some standard models just amp model no effects just see how clean sound was amp just hissed if had volume cranked distortion pedal engaged at max master volume was at no effects were turned ve never heard clean channel so much noise behind even when there was no plugged all could hear while playing was underlying hiss coming through notes very distracting drove me nuts isn ground loop issue other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes beyond clearly defect product dirty pre sets lots gain extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing plugged at low master volume d think was running few super high gain stomp boxes red hot single coil nothing was plugged all get staticy hiss at low levels wtf next issue weird fizz sound was especially noticeable low e after striking string instead clean note there weird fizzy digital artifact like sound surrounds note fades string stops moving almost sounds like cymbals crashing poorly authored mp3 file at low bit rate frequency whole chords break down decay fizzy envelope really makes thing unplayable weird thing neither one these problems arose head phones plugged or when was connected computed via either usb or line m going be stuck playing watt amp through pc or cans got iii instead ii because power behind touted celestion speaker read many reviews online or forum posts many amp related websites there page forum post fender support site quite interesting ll find these amps having issues apparently mustang ii don these issues firmware update did nothing correct amp hardware issue software issue speaker issue there speculation lcd screen which present or ii may be causing problems no one seems know sure fender doesn seem care definitely try before buy may get an amp doesn these problems may notice sounds or may even care let your ears tell what sounds good amp has lot potential great sounds would been nice faithful modeling some great vintage amps opinion technical issues made amp sound like complete garbage am disappointed fender hasn yet correct what ever wrong some folks claim fender reps say know what wrong m taking fact they acknowledged there something wrong whatever took back after few days playing trying eliminate junk sounds without success built noise gate helps little sucks tone picked up watt marshall instead guess what clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked how about even when engage dirt box one dirty channels there minimal noise ll knock fender correcting issue regardless what what caused they do some other nice amps d like try before buy another fender amp ll take test drive suggest do same before picking up one these turds

136	 price can beat works well any one would bought at local stores when first saw item wondered why regular version bass version only suddenly an amazing clarity came over me realized bass version only has tune four strings instead six so costs less because we don need use much then remembered there string bass guitars thought okay shouldn they one string bass guitars sadly universal clarity became even more muddied when realized some dismay there even string bass guitars will even work string bass after all more strings than its intended purpose these perplexing questions aside find be an excellent ideal tool its function three fold string winder2 string cutter3 peg pullerso no more running wire clippers pull peg or cut string all tools need change strings one reasonably priced tool made by d addario quality lives up brand solid wire cutter peg puller well designed does everything supposed do does well good construction pros good strong well designed unitcons winder held by single screw there numerous reports screw coming unscrewed during use would recommend putting drop super glue down screw thread area secure screw prevent happening because design flaw stars instead note there reviews here old four years appears device has undergone design changes during time some say head bowl so deep can result scratching head others report being so shallow slips off keys what believe mistake sell bass standard version same page from what can deduce from reviews appears some folks inadvertently purchased bass version which does indeed wide deep cup did realize imho two products should be listed two different pages clarity obvious from reviews some folks accidentally purchased wrong unit some reported peg puller being metal scratching bridge one mine vinyl while hard enough scratch bridge if one isn careful same holds true needle nose pliers bottom line there some responsibility user pay attention what they re doing don get rush be aware need protect their instrument while using any modification tool suspect if one going get hurry try change strings seconds they may wind up damaging their turn light put reading glasses if necessary see take your time device should work fine be aware when reading reviews many seem be out date dunno why company didn simply start new listing when redesigning device regardless string itself insist honesty advertising marketing so when was earnestly considering ordering string read summary which was stated elixir strings coated unique way protect wound strings from your dna other contaminants ohhhh protects string from dna yeah dna really messes up strings all right fact worst contaminant ever worse even than oils acids our skin worse than cells themselves contain hold dna from exposure because dna blueprint those cells contained deep within protective walls somehow nasty ol dna leaks out contaminates our strings honestly like none us ever attended biology class because we re musicians read reviews noted review after review after review seemed like some sort marketing promo noticed one those reviews indicated they had actually purchased product from amazon hmmmm first honest review found was one which said these strings sound somewhat artificial ah finally one real reviews look product may be good or may be best string ever or am going spend time money testing string apparently can stand its own quality without bogus marketing hype we re musicians morons if want us buy string be totally honest marketing quality string will sell itself by performance sound long life no matter how heavy marketing hype if string bad ll only sell one set if good don need hype edit follow up after reading numerous reviews does actually seem be good set strings which means product can stand customer testimony alone shouldn need spin sell just sayin one doesn get much better than d addario strings opinion they re twice clear martin strings exps just last forever like standard phosphor bronze just well use those less expensive alternative certainly recommend d addario nylon strings classical guitars ve heard no other string has crisp clean rich sound brand strings ve used them years once while give temptation try another brand always come back one different diameter strings will sound significantly different depending use prefer mid range string set overall depth sound mellow beauty tone any lighter sounds tinny any heavier fear strings putting undue stress neck these just right usually play classical nylon string an ovation deep bowl acoustic electric well after original strings wore out never found strings really liked don ask me why never thought about contacting ovation asking them what they use from factory one those duh things didn even think until just now based reviews questions answered here amazon purchased triple set strings instant gratification first they tuned up quickly retained their tune relatively respectable basis no new string holds tune perfectly first couple days these retained tune fairly well sound excellent playability comfy tone ovation was back here itemized observations first three sets currently cannot beat value price brilliance what many people call bright brilliance opposite dull some strings sound dull right out package these strings brilliant bringing out full tone maximum volume from tone natural tone allowed shine through no hint tinniness plunk or twang mellow mellow difficult define best definition ve heard ah sounds nice mellow string settling into becoming part pleasantness doesn grate your ears when pluck string these strings medium mellow just enough allow one enjoy sound without falling asleep balance at first e overtoned b e strings settled became less pronounced strings balanced right out trebles became clearly audible while e provided just right touch bass comfort 53mm diameter these strings comfortable fingers thicker strings often more difficult play can even damage some guitars lighter gauge tends cut into fingers unless has excellent action these strings just right especially 53mm e which provides proper amount bass without overkill or difficulty strumming summary these excellent strings which doesn surprise me since ve use d addario classical strings years martin ghs both good strings somehow d addario just shines thanks amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide give these try highly recommended string compares significantly pro arte string sizes same costs buck or two less so similar contacted d addario ask them what difference was they stated pro arte strings made better nylon more stringent specs all honesty wonder if strings aren identical these marketed primarily students schools more economical string whatever actuality both sets quality manufacture they re d addario d addario never produces junk their cheapest string good or better than more expensive strings other brands ve never used set d addario any classification didn like those who curious d recommend doing what did buy set these set pro arte they re both pretty inexpensive compare see which like best or if like both equally think would be good get several reviews here such test between two grades whichever set one ultimately chooses can go wrong quality price ratio notice mixed reviews here suppose when an item sells instead there may be potential quality control issues hey buy them if even one turns out be bad re still way ahead deal seems me good any connector ve ever bought ve tried several portable amps price honeytone can be beat has volume tone overdrive knobs overdrive can go way too over so easy one comes battery can be connected 9v adapter important note reverse polarity negative central interestingly found amp seems work significantly better acoustic electrics or piezo based pickups better than magnetic pickups small portable light weight practice amp which one can hook belt attach an earphone they don come much better has belt clip back ll supply your own earphones 9v adapter if want them battery included course cable required extra well worth money ve played some years found d addario strings be consistently good quality they one maybe three companies trust manufacture good set strings no matter what classification instrument whether classical nylon acoustic brass or electric nickel their strings produce excellent sound durable like any string one needs match size construct personal playing style comes through reading reviews quite often simply testing ve never played set brand didn like they always provide vibrant tonal quality no don work d addario just long time fan item body plastic rather than metal be expected at price would call sturdy at least instead works professional musicians may be impressed there some occasional noise issues ve found be true many behringer products nevertheless what works reasonably well received item good time there only one real dislike about item battery access goofy access battery one must take foot pedal off by inserting an ink pen into hinges two hinges two hands tricky process at best easiest battery access ve ever seen however be fair relatively minor issue insurmountable became relatively skilled at short time initially product didn work all could hear was static out amp thought had defective unit then noticed gain was turned up right out box turned down sound got much better traced an additional problem an old unshielded cable replaced good one sound smoothed out sensitive unit wide gain tone range has excellent bass treble tuners did seem be somewhat sensitive movement noises so apparently there no noise filter any kind box jiggling cords could cause static cut out could be cord issues or box issues ll experiment more later does some hiss easily audible room environment behringer seems problem hiss their products dunno why once sound comes out difficult discern hiss extremely loud or annoying just there bottom line cheap unit at cheap price does job should work fine most instances where such device would be needed such passive pickup non powered acoustic instruments d recommend those who need such thing simply because relative ease use foot petal off switch relative low cost just so so estimate some cases so so good enough purchased instrument brand new an impulse whim due managers choice sale at local music shop simply could ignore was brand new unopened box they allowed me examine prior purchase environment thought nice instrument however can be difficult properly examine an instrument busy store store was very busy noisy when get home can examine leisurely peace quiet details stand out indeed string ukulele measures bit over top bottom has sound baritone uke heard throatier more mellow instruments same price range advantage course string so if re player can achieve ukulele sound portability without learning totally new fingering course until realize while has strings tuned like tuned adgcea rather than eadgbe one cannot simply play music instrument all such music has be transposed or new chord name recognition learned being total newbie ukes was news me until got home read instructions so primary purpose purchasing small portable hit snag now totally end thing because can be little inventive use alternate string sizes tune standard tuning takes bit experimentation possible set up standard tuning if one doesn mind buying couple string sets playing mixup so all lost there was just an unexpected surprise mainly because didn research instrument prior purchase rare impulse buy so tuning aside we get quality instrument where yamaha really falls short an oil rather than lacquer or shellac finish several places oil was still visible could be wiped away by hand there were couple glitches finish straight out box was rush job out factory no finish work at all was blatantly obvious there no strap pegs those will require being added by hand difficult extra expense time action course too high unusual truth quite common off shelf stringed instruments came no surprise along other failures workmanship stood out here however thing bothers me most if wasn aware yamaha guitalele d think was cheap knock off child there one thing about instrument says quality which quite disappointing instrument sells about low cost obvious cheap every way can honestly say toy reeks beginner instrument tuners cheap they come finish cheap there no decoration no protective edging finish unfinished bought solely based number positive reviews here amazon respect those reviews people different tastes some folks has home made feel they will love however ve been playing mumblety mumble deca uh years know difference between quaint cheap own two ovation guitars peavey electric bass hand made violin an epiphone electric uke which such higher quality even contest no m hawking epiphone facts facts all can read very positive review epiphone amazon when got home took good look at found no sign quality or craftsmanship nothing said anything more than was made cheaply quickly humanly possible truth only positive thing say about does spruce top strings reasonably decent quality other than those two factors one can find full size guitars all over amazon equal or surpass instrument quality only benefit would offer its smaller size ukulele voice if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable tuned like uke other than its portability find no special merit even at its relatively low price consider over priced or rather under made one must grant largely matter personal taste expectation low quality low quality edit two weeks later just today saw cordoba at local store direct competition instrument cordoba much nicer built better has better sound finished out much more nicely sorry yamaha facts facts had seen cordoba yamaha side by side d bought kept cordoba honest review know some will disagree others know exactly what mean isn an expensive instrument so one really can expect super fine quality at price however paid about same price electric uke superb quality from top bottom mentioned cordoba better instrument costs same fortunately local merchant has satisfaction guarantee was able return simply cannot recommend instrument unless there no better options frankly there first we realize pickup or even pickup less than ten bucks has specially designed clamp good attaching sound hole such going work an instrument without considerable size sound hole also will tend get way those who play directly over sound hole quite easy hit will pick up any contact noise more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices unless run directly into amp within distance ft also going need coupler allow connect an extension cord will need such extension tends significant feedback issues if amp too close or facing passive pickup so will need either an amp passive specific input or preamp mixer or other preamp device if don preamp system will do no good so because limitations rate above what does though providing passive pickup can be quickly switched out between instruments does okay believe there better pickup concepts out there about same amount money including adhesive disk mikes would prefer permanently mount pickup some kind there many low cost pickups out there choose from slightly different concept removable price worth checking cheaper alternative string swing wall mount considerably less expensive works fine easy mount easy adjust holds instrument well only downside wall anchors aren heavy duty plastic screw types smaller drill hole hammer place types which neither convenient nor solid mount others course can always purchase couple screw heavy duty mounts ll still save considerably course doesn beautiful hardwood finish string swing lower price get black plastic sturdy enough looks fine does job if had sturdier wall mounts d give stars cheaper less trustworthy mounts bring stars nod being an inexpensive alternative great hanging ukuleles mandolins sturdier screw mounts should hold any size product unique tiny would be very useful if were more accurate problem just responsive enough get work one has place low headpiece next nut strum string pretty loud consistent register placing at top headpiece simply doesn pick up enough string vibration register well problem placing next nut then makes impossible hang wall mount hanger may seem like small issue if use such device regularly many home players do myself guitars hanging living room wall doesn make valueless can always clip top headpiece then move when re ready tune thus give stars however there other more responsive tuners such capo tuners we ve seen amazon lately they re about same price actually capo tuners bit less expensive ve found capo tuners be considerably more responsive so bottom line m impressed these aren an expensive tuner comparatively speaking good they really don do all great job they re unresponsive enough honestly think person might break string before realizing tuner isn responding current string pluck note ovation players clip tuner there simply no place clip fortunately ovation has built tuning if an ovation acoustic ll want different tuner

free m frankly sick tired showing up gig having keyboard run through p thereby essence causing me forfeit all control instrument bandleader or board op still ve had concede amps ve been using roland kc150 then kc350 had plenty power pop no sonic attributes would recommend them above bose p set up band uses then because needed small amp an xlr connection use an emergency p picked up relatively new item from roland which prominently describes itself monitor amp e meant only performer ears was surprised when got thing home put through some rounds kurzweil pc2 sp2 little more than compact brick appears power kc150 more importantly terms listenability sounds like its several heavens apart from kc or those ever present roland kc amps will make any piano including rolands sound uninspiring if boring during course four hour gig latest contender covers entire piano range effortlessly smoothly providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed brilliant strident highs perhaps some would judge sound trifle colored if so ll take coloration any day untempered sounds ve been getting from electric keyboards mid range tight controlled upper register growing out gradually unmistakably by contrast upper register heavy duty kc amps strikes like serpent leaping out mix like home brewed white lightning hitting palate after just gotten accustomed vintage bordeaux even compared little thing previous standard roland cube had preceded kc150 which has been around too long new one was smoother bending bass notes like gracious willow springing top ones like fresh spring birch other words even roland cube sounded uneven rough compared latest overachiever which handled tones scale like single portamento revealing no holes any registers playing any instrument or amplifier job can lead judgment radically different from one made at home if instruments m usually playing be mixed through p fine won listen them they ll be processed by monitor which will be facing playing me before kicks out stuff bandleader deems worthy public ears little doubt blue icicle will get job done shure sm or similar dynamic microphone its claim will convert any condenser mic even one normally requires xlr connection phantom power into plug n play usb mic should be taken at face value say because an acquaintance original audio technica at2020 condenser mic who had intermittent marginal success when he tried such conversion long run he would been ahead terms both conversion saving few bucks by purchasing at2020 usb mic blue icicle probably best such converter market comparably priced lightsnake cable will convert condenser mics despite what may read so if necessary give try more than one make sure there return privileges having misplaced blue snowflake usb mic decided give recently introduced competitively priced usb mic from samson try samson maker highly popular effective zoom personal digital recorders h2 h4n an attractive fully outfitted piece equipment handsome packaging small black box zippered carrying case aesthetics apparently inspired by ipod smaller lighter than snowflake more diminutive than picture would suggest yet audio quality strikes me being somewhat warmer richer favoring bass frequencies spoken narration more than snowflake which has slightly cleaner clearer definition at treble end samson go was seen instantly by imac recording was advertised plug n play mic somewhat more sophisticated than snowflake terms latency settings permits direct monitoring via headphones connected mic insure no delay or lag time between transmission reception there three way switch directional patterns manual could be clearer however about difference between cardioid cardioid pad no matter mic performed virtually flawlessly right out box no tampering switch extremely sensitive slightly more so than snowflake yet was unable avoid p popping sounds regardless how close got mic muted consonants so be prepared addition some sort pop filter device either one sold amazon or self designed one using nylon stocking mic can be clipped top computer screen or mounted mic stand using supplied adapter or ordering properly sized one from samson yet its heavy base plus flexible tilting mic can be placed flat surface much like snowflake greater stability without any intrusive cable snowflake tends flop around requiring some balancing device by user biggest disappointment thus far clip alluded by another reviewer does open far enough attachment desk top computer should be an ideal fit most notebook machines although snowflake doesn use spring clip suffers from same limitation if re especially concerned about durability snowflake appears be heavier more rugged mic thick metal no tiny switches or spring clips wear out samson more delicate refined two don kid yourself either mic will exceed capabilities your computer built mic perhaps owner expectations other hand neither match shure sm7b m accustomed using at local broadcasting studio still samson would appear winner little wonder whether used conjunction computer record full frequencied music or realistic sounding narration m surprised maker amazon popular at2020 would go low mic imo fully valued even at its single digit price dynamic rather than condenser still requires loads power get up workable levels phantom power which requirement condenser mics would probably add sufficient heft very lightweight its optional plug off switch versatile enough quality sound moreover isn bad providing can hear be prepared plenty watts hand coax any appreciable sensitivity from non responsive creature haven tested recording purposes despite appearances mic no bargain

167	 so hard get an honest review any mike isn shure sm58 considered gold standard by which all others measured course at least part reputation deserved perhaps more durability sm58 than its sound couple sm58s couple pg58s was considering sm48 pg58 has slightly better specs almost identical price first thing noticed out box was pg58 slightly bigger slightly heavier also has different switch than sm58 metal screens protecting them aren interchangeable then plugged one microphone cable so settings would be identical tried both mikes one after other first speaking then singing playing then changed settings or more specifically effects eq pa repeated experiment speaking then singing while changing between mikes here what noticed sm58 slightly flatter mid range pg58 slightly brighter has touch more presence they about equal volume slight differences tone can be easily manipulated an eq or just ordinary tone controls neither was susceptible much feedback or vocal pop haven tried out side by side comparison live situation or even practice too time consuming interferes playing difficulty judge those situations too or at least awkward used combination two practice no one seems be able tell difference except one person actually expressed preference pg58 could be just settings looked at specs two mikes side by side sm58 little flatter response especially at high end over 10k hz picks up few db before pg somewhere between hz however since human vocal range generally between around hz neither these seems likely much effect although sm58 might be tad more responsive bass singer also tried out two different behringer mikes radio shack mike behringer was totally outclassed by both shures sounding tinny thin little presence or volume tried out behringer 2000xm was impressed by similarity these mikes sound almost identical b shure sm behringer 2000xm seems been discontinued though replaced 1800xm an inferior mike offered bundles three under then plugged radio shack mike was spare backup even taken out practice model number probably also discontinued was an excellent sounding mike good volume presence tone didn any other mikes test side by side experiment did reach some conclusions there quite bit snobbery choosing microphones shure sm58 held up some unreachable standard they sturdy they good mikes price unreasonable at around however there other microphones which sound nearly identical also sturdy reliable at lower prices including shure pg58 most likely sm48 though didn any those test wish more people would give unbiased reviews based actual performance instead condescension toward those who either budget or looking alternatives standard bearer m giving stars only because haven had enough time give an evaluation how holds up comparison sm58 had boss blues driver pedal really liked until got behringer tube overdrive blues or at least want gritty dirty sound one implies some hurt implicit blues music was happy boss decided try b pedal m glad did compared them side by side tube overdrive was much grittier like small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit perfect sound want can adjust amount distortion preference some like lot sound prefer just enough color sound shape desires leaving rest playing dynamics how attack strings ve now retired boss pedal careful comparison boss had cleaner slightly more clear sound which really an overdrive more distortion clear distortion if makes any sense does add sustain can compare b pedal effect which implies power barely held check just exactly what was after an interesting limited effect pedal bought mainly use non pedal steel pedal steel can bend notes pedals levers most steel players use volume pedal do swells however play standing up manipulating volume pedal was difficult control because balancing one foot sensitivity some pedals pedal gives simulation volume swells give steel distinctive sound sort like an automatic wah way works since steel always being played by picking individual strings no chording pedal works along technique combine sustainer make swells extend little gives fair approximation using volume pedal swell notes tried regular same chords does add an effect very distinctive single notes would depend song haven really found many instances where useful there either normally don want volume swells solos steel works very well one many behringer pedals offer unique stand alone sound chorus effects well known even included many amps featured almost every multi effects pedal like individual pedals because can add just what want instead relying someone else idea pre set chorus just about right has range sounds different situations very reliable well made there no problem b tough plastic cases if want metal housing some sentimental reason thinking metal automatically better or more durable than plastic just need push off switch bat baseballs had behringer dr ultra reverb was unhappy its tone limited selection reverb sounds although unit only more difference sound tone may well be difference quality sound one really sounds super once adjust your own preferences may every reverb sound has nice selection they cover an impressive range well giving option wet full or dry tinny sounds trails essentially adds some sustain there also an echo setting very pronounced though does add an echo like sound so complaints quality machine or range effects or their qualities there couple annoying inconveniences one bright blue light indicating has been commented before an array pedals one bright all others combined when can read dials because glare your eyes did find solution put dark nail polish over led bulb had put wait dry reapply several times get dimming desired second annoyance name pedal black letters against dark blue pedal color impossible read stage or even dim room lighting course can remember where or which one other behringer pedals all white lettering making them much easier read every b pedal has its own distinctive color so helps solution little dilemma was buy some white vinyl letters from office depot put them over words reverb pedal was annoying make these cosmetic changes now m much happier pedal can enjoy its sound instead focusing these minor irritations pedal does add reverb adjustable different effects range effects great difference them often very pronounced kind an empty sounding reverb opposed more lush effects reverb machine rv600 also from behringer only more far superior machine more effects better tone though has couple other minor drawbacks see review item clarification several behringer pedals all placed behringer pedal board most b pedals work quite well no quality issues them some people complain about plastic cases they tough reliable unless re habit abusing your pedals by smashing them around or can control your stomp pressure some better than others one works perfectly b pedals one them tuner each seems add some noise amp output especially when quiescent mode no signal input pedal placed at end line just before signal goes into amp quiets all noise other pedals generate had check because at first thought amp was making noise when bypassed all pedals amp was quiet which was relief then needed relief from pedal noise did trick controls little misleading easy get used adjust send receive function quieting noise send an additional effects pedal which seems pointless best way use put at end chain quiet all effects mute function may help when turn pedal tuner also functions mute had do little modification b pedal board make fit already had pedals place removal couple screws fit into slot meant longer pedal don actually need off function most time so placing sideways out way spot was no disadvantage just leave all time so always quiets noise when m actually playing however can still operate if necessary example mute function if needed aggravating pedal eliminate noise from other pedals at least there an easy solution noise gate like one isn best power supply available doesn truly isolate each input description says outputs isolated what means they independent if one input has short one will cease function other working inputs so short circuit protection isolated grounding can cause some issues noise there other things can cause noise too always just power supply making noise could be certain pedals cables or some combination factors power conditioner will sometimes help well however joyo provides plenty power enough 9v inputs each 12v 18v dependable solidly built comes plenty connectors small enough fit moderately sized pedal boards x pedals board these joyo units board about x there some noise don attribute just power supply takes some investigating maybe an experienced tech trace down m sure can ever be completely eliminated joyo itself seems produce very little third half price truly isolated units definite step up from daisy chain also has those cool blue lights can turn or off

173	 although mic now considered primarily an instrument mic was always case ve actually preferred same basic design live vocal use since when bought first one which was then known shure model unidyne iii mic got stolen about years ago remarkably was still working at time got boosted was still using when needed one an off switch function ve owned or used countless modern day sm sm along dozens other mics over years from all manufacturers fairly deep baritone bass type voice don need get closer than about or inches sm me sm sounds similar shure sm studio vocal mic if put windscreen get about inches away d only use an sm studio environment though because they slightly more fragile over four times expensive by design sm require get much closer mic get full range sound than sm prefer sm over sm vocal use because they sound crisper highs they sound fuller low end sm sounds more natural vocals never sounds muddy or muffled sm has one most pronounced proximity effects any mic ve ever used if tend shove mic down your throat may benefit from less dramatic proximity effect sm if ever going use an sm vocals d recommend buying shure a2ws windscreen genuine shure windscreen fits precisely locks securely onto sm sm will pop like mad without one only possible drawback sm57 vocal mic there no model available an off switch these days can find modern sm switch anywhere however if ve ever tried using mic when forgot switch was off position probably just became liability money sm best all around microphone past two generations stage use some recording purposes studio vocals d use an sm which really doesn sound all much different from sm when built variable eq sm set way like sm predecessors me best all around microphone since certainly most enduring durable can go wrong unless get too close no windscreen first all best microphone ever made what they cost they certainly more than expected give stars microphone period without even taking low cost into consideration they so much better than next cheapest thing they worth extra sure bought one behringer xm8500 then two more couple months later planning use them rehearsal microphones geezer band start up about years go however we actually used these vocals at some live performances when sound tech personal sm busy at another job honestly think we sound about same either way maybe little clearer behringers at one time alice cooper his band were using behringer xm8500 however they may moved now all know these shure sm clones even though they appear be cosmetic knockoffs they slightly hotter output more flat response ears while shure more pronounced lower mid boost makes male voice sound bigger sometimes more distorted if eq ed correctly they an ideal backup vocal microphone since behringer behaves like compromise between microphone tailored male voice microphone tailored female voice actually works well without heavy eq also if anything more versatile than sm can be useful an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working anything would ordinarily use an sm pick up doesn overload easily has high output tight pattern about same feedback rejection sm has reasonably decent blast filter so if using outdoor instrument pickup don add windscreen another strength these durability sustained numerous drops couple falls happened while boom stand mounted so only did microphone fall weight boom stand was behind adding more mass force fall no damage at all any them used cringe when they fell or got dropped now just shrug one weak point about these they more sensitive handling noise stand handling noise no issue mine came hard plastic foam lined cases stand adapters stand adapters sort flimsy usable if want sm need buy sm if want good all around microphone class then try one these no off switch these we do switches some sm we use frankly off switch liability don think can find better microphone new money recommend them decent all around microphone price can pay more get less device works here what does plug an electric bass into pedal instrument input then can plug second standard instrument cable into pedal high impedance output jack then plug one into bass amp also can connect low impedance microphone preamp via ohm low impedance xlr jack out can use just high impedance output or just xlr output or can use them both simultaneously when footswitch off functions transparently no tonal modification at all just like direct box when footswitch an led light activates tonal boost tube emulation functions put footswitch quotes because use fingers push leave all time personal purpose when insert plug into instrument input jack unit powers so if running battery be sure unplug input when actually using some other functional comments about runs volt batteries or volt power supply used batteries while switched an ac adapter battery life isn super satisfactory still if using lot suggest using an ac adapter when battery starts going sounds awful could put into bypass mode finish set also when footswitch off led lit thing functions straight xlr ouput direct box anything plug into could patch output an acoustic electric or output an electric pedal board use feed mixer recording direct which very handy feature home recording hobbyist amp emulation tone controls wrong anything other than electric bass so just use direct box tone emulation circuit off anything except bass controls all rotary knobs except ground lift switch which slide switch controls left right top row second row drive treble bass level presence ground lift slide switch blend taking each control one at time understand what they do important because they all logically placed drive knob adjusts amount gain similar cranking input stage control tube preamp here where can get something like tonal thickness or edge overdriven tube tone basically part circuit injects variable harmonics some more pleasing distortion out there purpose there no active passive pad switch or extra active input jack pedal so if an active bass then will turn drive knob up much get tone want treble knob or 12db boost cut upper frequency tones bass knob or 12db boost cut lower frequencies o clock flat or zero db boost or cut both treble bass knobs level knob master volume control all does control output volume no tonal coloration presence knob boosts upper frequency range harmonic content more attack your tone presence knob isn midrange control does boost upper mids ground lift switch only effects xlr output jack should be left off unless hook up there hum then can turn ground lift might help eliminate hum issue however better from safety standpoint remedy by eliminating electrical ground loop conflict causing hum blend knob controls amount tube emulation injected into pedal output all way left being none o clock being all way clockwise being cons very little bass gear or anything else perfect these days behringer gear has more build issues general across most their product line because using chinese parts labor how they keep costs down designed germany built china means get chinese components chinese build quality while specs look pretty enticing example at first battery change battery clip self destructed part clip terminal stayed stuck battery having pulled completely out clip was duracell battery standard pedal batteries went radio shack got replacement battery clips fixed new clip by soldering wires from new clip stripped wires cut away from old clip taping up solder joint ve never used stompbox because switch looks like will break if lean hard construction all plastic casing very durable based previous experience plastic switches stomp boxes know use size d foot treble presence knobs mine will generate hiss noise when set very high which may be noticeable at all vintage type bass amp no tweeter becomes glaring when using full range amp cabinet or when using xlr output recording or pa feed basically set treble presence point where hear hiss start then back off until goes completely away because functional limit hiss no issue bypass mode because preamp off jacks other than xlr plastic box jacks soldered direct circuit board pedal these type jacks noted causing problems especially after rough use so take easy them they should last very long time unit lacks any dedicated midrange knob presence knob does seem boost upper mids treble simultaneously some people who use pedal stage tool use solo or scoop switch slap tap solos so presence bass treble boost basically all need solo switch anyway pros first foremost price almost too good be true when consider price anything else similar features keep mind has durability issues so be gentle will last indefinitely isn tech nyc bass driver by any means works similar fashion one tech bass driver deluxe use at gigs tech sounds better costs about eight times what behringer cost use behringer at home save wear pedal board at home if didn tech unit might take unit gigs probably will last way longer way keep setup at home all time especially like unit when used small rehearsal practice type combos many these smaller combos passive type tone circuits basically at flat when tone cranked wide open device really makes these little amps sound more serious part beauty an active bass tone boost capability don get passive bass if passive bass can make sound more like an active bass treble bass boost front amp also useful boosting signal front longer cable run backline say anything over about feet recording xlr direct out very useful xlr direct out can also be used feed pa at gig if your amp doesn xlr direct out how use device bass plugged into input use xlr output connect microphone mixer output from microphone mixer patched into turtle beach santa cruz soundcard an xp computer can then record using computer recording software practice solo or can play along recorded music using headphones headphones can play loud want anytime want without disturbing anyone most computer speakers very inadequate electric bass so recommend headphones instead your typical desktop computer speakers can buy better computer speakers capable they will cost about same or actually more than decent bass practice combo amp quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers bass capable having owned pedal about years knowing what know about would buy again would strongly recommend home recording practice tool recommendation stage tool strong home use fine can use at gigs d be saving up gig bones buy something more durable better performance ve used electronic tuners long time most them ve owned plug into your instrument means they don tune microphone only an electronic signal directly from instrument bought korg ga was about size credit card built microphone tune acoustic instruments about or years ago used korg until getting snark korg was durable fairly accurate lcd display wasn lit making tough read low light needle seemed jump around sometimes no good reason still money korg was good deal tuner microphone day enter snark sn snark will tune about anything will tune either by vibration clipped onto headstock stringed instrument or don clip instrument use built microphone clip music stand clip anything still works when use built microphone upright bass violin saxophone trumpet or even tympani use vibration setting tuning an acoustic or electric or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources tunes about anything no matter notes or key want tune your instrument senses entire scale snark sn has well lit clean bright display easy read bright light or total darkness display pivots any angle very light so adds very little weight headstock battery seems last fairly long time longer than volt battery tuner pedal burns through pricey volt duracells at rate about per month long term durability seems be question me due small pivot all snark clip tuners ve only been using mine about months now while pivot part seems sort fragile ve had no issues at all yet still works good don think should drop very often so far ve dropped mine once no damage even if did break snarks cheaper than rack tuner snark just accurate while long term durability undecided can complain at all about versatility accuracy high visibility display or low cost really like mine use everyday an electric bass or ukulele or really gets around tunes them all color sort metallic red almost candy apple red ordered spare batteries haven needed change one yet d buy again suggest one gift any musician doesn one m sure they ll use often tuner real good buy at good price spare cr2032 lithium batteries less expensive amazon so suggest ordering several your tuner so ll be prepared ve never used metronome feature other than check out flashed locked tempo really don need feature ukulele straps rare thing ve yet find perfect one one gets close all uke players use straps some do some don purists say use one using one makes look lazy or inexperienced however two acoustic electric ukes they heavier than non electrified ones purists use ve found using strap electric ukes helps right arm fatigue from clutching thing preamp battery adds surprising amount weight percentage wise uke when compared neotech strap frees me up worry about strumming fingering techniques more dropping instrument less there another device called uke leash also works well ties onto headstock like neotech better because even though instrument isn balanced perfectly balanced better than uke leash uke leash easier get off body so has some advantage over neotech simple sling neotech simple sling soundhole clip strap works concert tenor ukes equally well adjust some when switching between two wide clip felt lined does scratch instrument don know how long felt lasts seems well attached strap should work fine any number various stringed instruments use reasonable care soundhole clip strap ukulele or can damage top by jerking down instrument clip neotech sling wider than most ve seen extra width reduces does completely eliminate risk wider clip spreads stress out ve seen other soundhole clip straps much narrower clips m afraid try them ukulele like one wide clip will keep uke leash type strap ties headstock still requires full right arm pressure hold instrument place so like neotech soundhole clip device better only thing don like about putting little clumsy when compared traditional strap once great look little dorky slipping your arm into then over your head can do hat gets easier more do d buy neotech simple sling again recommend electric ukelele players who want use strap don want drill holes strap buttons their ukes just put private because look dorky putting

venues recommended update marked product down one star after connector fell apart during what regarded relatively light duty set screw fell out could be found ve had similar problems other pyle products if buy them recommend tat get micro screwdriver set well so can tighten te connector screws before similar xperience can only repeat what everyone else has already said kyser capo designed built very well easy put adjust just easy take off there probably few capos out there bit flashier still pretty stylish price makes real bargain fine general stick inexpensive pick holder doesn hold very many picks really doesn would give five stars except really prefer planet waves led key chain pick holder over costs more has more functional value me if all need something very simple surface can stick then fine dava picks one life guilty little pleasures they may seem pricey picks they re still expensive bought batch picks when realized davas from three years back were all gone use these play slide also fender musician friend picks those just standard flat stamped out pieces plastic davas offer much better grip greater sense control they just plain feel good use other picks more tendency slip slide dava get great grip terrific value anyone who wants something like shure sm58 doesn want lay out bought myself kind experiment m learning blues harp wanted try out mikes could be used combination vocals harmonic playing reason mike had be one could cup hands also mount stand while astatic jt has great shape crunchy sound harp players love can easily mount stand use vocals spherical receiver makes xm8500 pretty easy cup hands torpedo body mounts easily onstage boom mike stand low impedance output feeds nicely into amps no need preamping or impedance matching no resulting noise or signal loss mike isn perfect its low cost generally excellent construction more than make up slight deficiencies here couple more casual notes mike picture looked bluish me what actually received was mike very nice black finish product description seems report weight ounces measured mike at ounces gives substantial feel although mike still bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes ve used mike has ohms impedance frequency response up hz bluesmen prefer cut off at give midrange boost tweaking can compensate extended range mike mike doesn an off switch perhaps its only real deficiency these switches really very handy actual use mike dosn seem very susceptible pops there no hiss mike comes pretty substantial hard shell carrying case molded foam interior more than enough protection find smaller zippered case be more convenient pacing mike suitcase if toting fair amount equipment around or storing at home then oversized case should work well hope helps purchased use sennheiser e825 microphone bestselling stage boom microphone stand mount has exceeded expectations fit stand perfect mount pivoted so mike can be adjusted up or down part actually holding mike flexible rubbery making very easy slide mike its cord out screw tightens te pivot if needs be fixed more firmly place all all very worthwhile economical purchase purchased interface xlr plug sennheiser e825 mike input amplifiers seemed work very well role was well constructed all connecting points working precisely securely somewhat after fact started worrying about whether should instead gotten an adapter impedance matching capabilities m hardly professional technician area did do enough research figure out good working answer lo z low impedance microphones say ohms or less generally do be matched solid state amplifiers which likely hi z high impedance inputs range ohms these amplifiers ae generally designed accommodate impedance ratio load source calculated signal loss such an arrangement range decibels which incidental corresponds what ears tell me adapter works just fine without impedance matching can say sure whether also holds tube amps will update review if chance find out update since wrote initial review discovered pyle seems problem securing its connectors properly set screws if purchase item suggest micro screwdriver set handy so can tighten everything up before discover your chagrin loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector fall apart bought two years ago use takamine hasn seen heavy use wasn supposed sits corner living room holds securely doesn cause problems although does make ownership more obvious yo neighbor was convinced year was drunk wailing away at am at least what she told police stand very similar slightly better selling musician gear stand they might actually be same stand under different names pricing both very close if consider shipping if were buy stand again would still get one because available under prime other one isn gives stand more value stand very easy set up lower cradle fixed adjusts itself appropriate position your took little getting used does work very well padding stand does protect well extended contact surface has caused any problems given very low price an excellent choice living room stand if re road or performing might need something bit different can definitely recommend casual players like myself micro amp real blast more ways than one toy don be misled by price real amp based stompbox electronics while may be marshall stack more than adequate highly portable practice amp well performance amp small spaces certainly loud hough evoke complaints from neighbors adjoining apartments bought amp use durng harmonica practice end use belt clip mount hip then just patch mike twiddle

used high impedance mike astatic jt low impedance mike behringer xm8500 electric fender stratocaster handles these without noticeable signal loss what amp exactly guess danelectric took circuitry its overdrive stompbox added watt amplifier circuit put whole shebang into retro case result quite appealing overall look feel one quality case solid albeit plastic three controls volume tone overdrive while detented smooth control tend get better components input inch jack mini jack headphone output all solid someone danelectric had sense humor touting unit leather strap though more decorative than useful if can operate an overdrive stompbox then know how work amp volume control obvious tone control alters bass treble mix very significantly opinion overdrive control adds fuzz distortion again great degree instructions describe sounds someone danelectric has sense humor otherwise why label one setting send cats under bed ignore instructions set controls whatever sounds good said small really toy ve personally found very useful practicing blues harp because so easy set up so ridiculously portable when decide m good enough panhandle penn station baby going me partial capo from kyser has same design construction ease use kyser top ranked bestselling string cano definitely recommended if choose go down he partial capo path though best either jam friends who familiar partial capos or buy randall wolliams manual partial capo since its use intuitively obvious bought lieu more expensive lee oskar rack m regular rack player just wanted something experiment rack constructed better than had really expected easy adjust however found fit around neck angle harmonica be bit awkward getting he harmonica unto te spring loaded holder can be bit tricky still good deal there just no way m going give five stars piece rubber what doesn even look quite good picture largely because picks laying top help lot dress up without those picks just black molded flab damnable thing flab actually quite useful bought whim cringed when opened up box last two weeks been propping takemine up against coffee table rubber thick enough non skid enough keeps place effortlessly may be much look at works really well top portion rests table surface about inch think there nub front hat pushes up against corner he surface fixes rest place about inch thick cost materials probably more than cents design sells thing if can find less at local shop go paid amazon even at consider good buy

206	 yes costs considerably more than sm58 m sure if could pass comparison test between two love mic me sounds slightly brighter clearer than 58s used past if musician who strapped cash or trying make ends meet get if extra dough want confidence boost go beta would buy again there isn much say about product except works advertised if don one these live performer highly recommend pony up few dollars pick one up pun intended recommend pedal anyone considering volume pedal super sturdy transparent fully expect very long time tuner out nice feature serious selling point quality go no further your volume pedal needs device best can buy there nothing negative write about if put slightly high price aside zero noise indestructible casing if reading review considering investing best can buy your rig do there some things life don want think about your tuner one them enough think about stage without worrying about your tuner fast reliable looks great pedal board true bypass doesn add bit noise nor suck any tone at all your brand preference will guide your decision don shy away from well made piece equipment would buy again

209	 beta 58a along original sm58 industry standards well known general purpose workhorse live vocals they by far most popular tools out there quality venues throughout country commonly stock these their go house mics fact noticed betas all over place at small theater high end system played at just recently had used old years before moving beta there certainly noticeable difference between two beta definitetly hotter more sensitive response your vocals will cut into mix strongly more clarity than might be used mids highs picked up perfectly when singing few inches away there subtle low frequency roll off avoid boomy muddled sound typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close definitely need stay within close range though pickup pattern very tight good thing because extraneous noise feedback effectively rejected built like tank probably bit overused when describing products shure vocal mics truly earn title they can take an enormous amount abuse never falter toss around drop bury under other stuff etc no problem when maintaining bunch music gear nice tools never worry about reason d highly recommend getting used one if can find deal chances its working order no matter what ve been using nanoweb polyweb no idea what difference elixirs consistently years now martin jumbo cutaway periodically try out other brands whenever see something might compete especially when another extended life or coated string released would happily bail elixir at set if someone offered cheaper option worked well fact was quite optimistic about d addario exps until heard their tone begin evaporate after few days like any other string nothing ve used up point has gotten close challenging quality mighty purple box sound get from these day crisp beautiful expected where elixirs kill competition though after hours play they show their strength will still hear fresh bright tones from them when any other set would already crossed into dead zone fact typically start breaking them before they begin sound too dull play relatively aggressively use palm muting constantly allowing skin oils eat right through strings at bridge saying tone lasts 5x longer stated box might be stretch there no question get at least double life out these at less than twice cost alternatives if an occasional player or music shop owner these no brainer coating extremely effective at combating effects time oxygen exposure everyday aggressive player will simply get better tone longer life one nit picky point criticism packaging an issue me why would any manufacturer still utilize tree killing paper envelopes allow strings get stale m seriously asking ve got be missing something here shred plastic sealed around all strings greener more cost efficient keeps strings fresh thank d addario ll never leave your electric strings would happily buy elixirs bulk if had faith their shelf life complaints about these snapping prematurely probably valid happening when someone gets set been sitting around while think them perishable buy them from places move lot units like amazon ordered one these because like other planet waves capo lot believe its older metal version lite however one just does screw down enough hold down strings especially down at lower frets where neck little thinner martin jumbo acoustic will barely bend strings down behind fret enough prevent buzzing your fretting hand will naturally push capo back out position quite easily when playing open chords too m sure why plastic version has issue when appears an identical design old metal one doesn seem defective no parts bent or missing far can tell unless just happen get one shorter than normal screw wouldn recommend any without thick neck recommendation classic kyser capo thats more dependable quicker apply remove also attaches your headstock effortlessly when use if looking screw down style would look older version avoid lite ve been using standard size pedaltrain years was tired adhesive pedal side velcro strips inevitably coming loose after being moved around bit use keep pedals place line m5 seymour duncan twin tube classic live wire b switch first two pretty heavy bulky needed something substantial keep them their spots especially during transport case being carried vertically other electronics bunch cables top them decided try out power grip been extremely impressed first stripped old velcro stuff off pedals board cleaned surfaces thouroughly all came off pretty easily then applied one strip power grip each bottom panels pedaltrain individual pieces bottom pedals then let everything sit hours recommended after attaching pedals was amazed at how well everything was secured pedals only being held by one strip higher panel other strip just padding under bottom sides pedals prevent metal metal abrasion however can confidently hold whole thing vertically shake aggressively without anything going anywhere also appreciate can pull pedals off board move them around some effort grip will release without adhesive budging even bit grip also bonds itself unlike velcro where re keeping track male female tape when replacing would recommend following manufacturer instructions applying stuff clean hard non porous surfaces ve heard adhesive doesn work rubber wood etc many pedals rubber padding feet bottom ve had no trouble prying stuff right off before putting tape will appreciate stability security convenience stuff provides get few rolls meter doesn go far d think

221	 like camo capo simplicity its unique color friend got new one after seeing me using his bit shorter than mine mine works both uke acoustic no problem use single hand manufactor suggests its duration don clip when use bought using danelectro mini amp so don need worry about battery works perfectly an adaptor should be won any surprise by its performance two stars out because comparing price mini amp less than adaptor pricy still saves me long runs brought set beasue one strings broke kid size also wanted backup strings haven tried many different strings used strings d addario exp came takamine gs330s been good year iif strings break will try one gs330s well over all think d addario great warm balance tones after strings were set stretch few days playing stays tune strings were set more than months they still playable sounds okay kid size don think there will be any problem if strings gs330s m happy purchase quality strings more than months mostly use practicing metronome another tuner which set eadgbe much easy tune without any confusion although tuner has flexibility tuning differently confusing me because keeps changing chord going left right or more however bonus using tuner don bring all classes metronome which initial purpose purchase great enough adjustable calibration beats rhythms tempos practices brough trying electric feels acoustic don want waste too much money electric acoustic preamp or big amp if don like efeels after researching awhile reading tons good reveiws decided give try didn expect too much amp surprisingly positively gives me more than ask also brough adaptor which great save long runs don worry about battery home practices adorable out box looks like lovely toy works professionally based its 10w amp don care much about manufactor suggested modes basically just fool around three button controls whatever sounds like different songs uke like small size won take too much space tiny room cute look at practical too had high frequence feedback one reviwers when used poor pickup however when changed another one can turn volume high want same direction setup previous poor pickup almost thought was an issue from amp luckily two different pickups try deeply after using better pickup amp doesn any issue yet used few times so don know about its longevity yet one more thing about headphone mode completely silent because sound itself won be muted headphone does mute effected sounds from amp anyway great feature very smart handy design acoustic doesn be drilled hole very easy buckle strap neck its botton button got right b4 x mas thanks amazon one best value purchased suction design great any size string instruments uke small soundholded guitars or acoustic guitars thanks previous viewers tip moisture suction b4 pressuring surface next bridge stays great pickups perfectly without any unwanted noise from pickup wire itself recently bought another one does great value quality spent ever been using olympus vn recording piano singing sessions want upgrade dr o7mkii stereo connecting computer has more features me learn new songs rather than recording tasks used few times record piano singing recitals practices sounds amazing much better than vn price worth spend haven fully utilized yet didn time study menu completely so just checked menu whatever need at stage so far am happy what got recording quality from guy build light which good its plastic material kinda cheap most reviewer commented size bulky think can be shorten dr too bad don need channels yet even though can use practices session ended up picked dr 07mkii slightly less bought x mas gift got promotion rebate at time mailed whatever needed rebate vendor almost weeks still haven gotten any notice from vendor besides vendor requests cut bar code label from original box filled form rebate which make me dislike if they don rebate me can return neither since original was cut trashed feel like tricky rebate downgrade o star after returning back brookmays seller am really disappointed by seller brookmays ignorant responses return defective cherbub pickup which picks up unwanted noise by wire own movements high frequency feedback other pickup won same issue after two weeks returned item was delivered didn hear anything from seller regarding return so emailed seller see if we can settle asap too bad four days after email had been sent only got email telling me case message sent without any further response refund until patience gone deal hassle don think worth waste more time despite fact wasting time money spent useless pickup shipping costs therefore yesterday emailed last contact seller regarding refund purchase gonna report amazon about bad after sale service ever before if still haven heard from seller shorty today finally received seller response refund seller denies issues pickup claims was defective all pickups going get unwanted noise if move feedback can be many other issues issued refund obviously reply unconvincing although feedback can be raised from varies issues tried another pickup same directions setups doesn such problems at all fact all pickups get unwanted noise although didn try many pickups cherub pickup doesn work product description pickup original tones instrument regardless surrounding noises moreover unwanted loud noise from its wire movements really annoying there no way stop wire movements while strumming indeed won use don want sit at house useless property so returning back seller may help improve issues has however hassles got from seller totally unexpected worth at all by way m also unhappy about refund bought along amazon free shipping purchase or more me money fair buyer who doesn get right service quality from purchase only wastes times money matter so if really need pickup your instrument highly recommend spend few more dollars get much better reliable one don make same mistake did try one because cheap price turn may get more hassles than expect such cheap merchandise don want happens anyone else so decided tell what went through keep from possible hassles before betting stars 1st review after using twice like clip design which easy use so worth stars however doesn work well clipping small soundholed string instruments like ukes kid size guitars because touches strings besides also picks up loudly through wire own movements description regardless surrounding noises distressed from those unwanted loud noises one more thing somehow produces much higher feedback mini amp use turn volume low possible prevent high frequency feedback however when switch another pickup same setup mini amp acoustic guitars or uke amp doesn any feedback even turning almost highest volume other pickup doesn unwanted noise from its own movement either don know whether lack luck or poor pickup got bought because its cheap price less than clip design can accept noises waste shipping cost return back seller so if want give try may bear mind seller brookmays doesn take any responsibility shipments even item doesn work properly claimed description good luck then

week ago was told me they wouldn get back stock until december then surprise squier strat was delivered yesterday yay d happiness was able get squier perfectly intonated red burst like legacy fender

both speed ease use its triple spring action provides leverage needed opening or closing much less effort every bit well built kyser also has couple features kyser lacks integrated pick holderi m always losing picks god knows how many picks ve run through so pick holder very very handy feature tension adjustmentwith capo attached mywashburnat lowest tension g string would buzz at maximum tension capo has stronger grip than kyser which makes buzz free playing experience planet waves capo definitely gives kyser run its money years kyser had been favorite capo having found planet waves

253	 works great little annoying tighten loosen screw use every time some responses comments ve seen reviews ve had mine years used moderately wear metal from bottom screw negligible haven put pad there or anything manual screw functionality does feel give an added level control can make very tight ensure no buzz however range motion wide side get properly capo first fret acoustic put right edge 1st string screw down all way does sometimes leave some buzz price nice though so would recommend perfectly fine capo was surprised by size very small unobtrusive older has decal top head which made small size bit an issue cleverly designed swivel pad wide opening clip snark could still easily manage tuning dead couldn be more convenient since based vibration performance completely unaffected by outside noise also don try balance anything your knee or use table hold your standard audio tuner just clip swivel head face really like design attractive overly loud color nice non slip surface display bright interface very intuitive just press button start plucking strings addition snark customer service was very friendly helpful putting two cents aside anyone who plays should learn tune by sound without tuner given one notes highly recommend snark tuner only just received these thought d give first impression purchased headphones because figured was more pleasant way listen music at work than ear type chose model because they were sale seemed be diamond rough reviews indicated would be good large heads wear an xl hat size build average they don feel flimsy hands can see plastic parts nothing special strength wise padding headband little uneven seam open up headband put unit your head sort looks warped meter cable attached base left headphone headphones can both swivel degrees forward maybe degrees back degrees downward swivel joint above ear pieces allow them fold upward into headband listened about minutes music straight start was pretty pleased m especially particular do like good sound there some good bass classical music was clear headphones did make me realize had low quality recordings few songs tried out listening hd equivalent youtube cleared up problems heard wasn totally blown away either do hear little noise when they re plugged into computer nothing playing though so ipod so m sure if can be blamed headphones they comfortable comfortable d like do feel some pushing against ears round ear pads aren big enough fit whole ear they do get warmer than d like definitely feel relieved them off think they noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour was little hesitant get over ear headphones fear unfortunately did turn out be problem who knows maybe they ll wear improve ll update review if more report now d say they re worth cost even if they aren shining diamond rough if could give about stars would now ll give they accurately priced overall typical quality product some exceptional pros balanced by some cons update ve been stretching out headphones box couple days helped bit what funny adjustable portion can get huge comfortable head at about 3rd size notches pushing against your head tight part if adjust them larger they just fall below your ears rather than loosen up also compared them sennheiser hd201 tascams better sound sennheiser more comfortable they re lighter ear cups oval shaped fit better update think box stretching has been helping m able wear them about hours now before notice them getting uncomfortable still relatively short amount time update headphones been living box just wider than head anytime they aren use comfort marginally improving m guessing due stretching out head ears getting used pressure me learning ways sort adjust them periodically shift pressure however think rating will remain at stars sound good enough give couple stars price low enough one more however month should be long enough phones break standard usable degree hasn happened satisfaction conclusion would suggest find different pair if an exceptionally big head mine about 61cm circumference or us hat size clamping definitely leads discomfort round ear pads don quite do trick makes your head pretty warm unbearable if can find an alternative probably best being said note only reduced stars fit can speak someone bit smaller head ears if these fit comfortably which imagine they would many people they star product great sounding sturdy enough build etc update friend mine picked up pair audio technica m50s around same time bought pair was able try them out compare good half hour today m very experienced sound quality felt m50s were definitely winner most obvious difference was added volume generally sound was more pleasing ears bass seemed more supported higher notes felt smoother less static like etc besides volume these differences weren huge had compare somewhat carefully notice them point update just say aren getting headphones tascams getting very good headphones sound which should more than satisfy most people think re pursuing diminishing returns sound quality alone pay much more than headphones case d pay 5x more m50s don think re getting 5x sound quality m50s significantly more comfortable though they do make your ears warmer build feels better stronger smoother adjustments prettier etc all these things combined may start consider price difference reasonable

273	 bought pick holder because hate putting pick between strings hold because can play pick your strings originally thought thing would be kind large go all way across headstock boy was wrong picture misleading thing tiny barely goes across three string wedges under neath two strings can put two picks maybe more if they thin into wedges top stays place well very convenient only negative don know how long will hold up think maybe thicker rubber rather than foam rubber would held up better can see thing eventually losing tension pick holder wedges dropping picks got these picks week ago fell love them generally use dunlop 0m pick switch thinner pick rhythm play course can be very annoying especially if playing rhythm lead parts same song these big stubby picks solved problem they easy hold onto great leads because way they shaped don hang strings like regular picks do great picks definitely worth little extra they cost love these strings use them exclusively gibson lp studio deluxe because seems corrode ordinary strings quickly washburn glossy sealed looking fretboard doesn problem still prefer these strings well they tend be little stiffer than ernie ball like way they sound they feel great when bending sliding can keep these weeks daily playing without corrosion deadness get other brands gibson les paul bought used when arrived fretboard was good shape very dry first tried lemon oil would work about week fretboard would feel dry an ashy color its rosewood so started looking another solution found gerlitz honey ordered applied few hours later restrung started playing didn care way fretboard felt think because honey little thicker than lemon oil felt little slimy because wasn completely dry decided give another hours next day neck looked played great darker color than any untreated rosewood fretboards plays like champ bends slides smoother than ever great product one will continue use if need quick treatment before gig or something would recommend lemon oil because dries quickly would use every other regular maintenance situation finally purchased line tuner replace hand held cheap tuner thing way more accurate than old tuner because true bypass doesn suck any your tone haven used battery pack so don know about battery life use one spot plug power another nice feature can set turn off volume when use or leave volume very heavy seems sturdy well built display little confusing at first once read manual makes good sense easy use

302	 just put dot hollowbody big heavy strap looks good does job like how looks feels would buy another one just like price was great had gibson name was great value stars found perfect strings these them will use these lower end stuff will probably sell anyway we all our preferences m an ernie ball fan they re cheap though these gold standard all strat type electrics fender or put these all strats regardless brand they durable enough take pounding sound great tend play strats bit rougher than gibson or acoustics so these well tested house get bit carried away amp volume tend bend strings bit will continue using these all strats until find something better which haven yet do use other strings other types guitars can see reviews those well these bullet proof they take pounding last long could expect perfect re stringing your very portable too fits gig bag spare strings price was right too must tool isn cheap like most plastic ones out there nice thing about one cuts off excess ease just looks better trimmed neatly star product wasn quite sure what expect few old guitars pretty weathered looking fingerboards figured d give try am so glad did could believe how much residue was rag after cleaned fret board yuk then used treatment product treat really brought out natural color d like say looks like new so would be stretch looks heck lot better almost new used one less valuable acoustics still usa made fender such faith m going do gibson acoustic next then couple electrics will do when change strings them stuff great put these one gibson les pauls so far so good great sound no wear after one session unlike d addario strings will update few weeks see how long they last these picks perfect they just right feel medium look awesome what more can say about picks other than they perfect these picks far exceed expectations mean how good could pick be anyway these classiest nicest looking picks own they look great feel great play great call me snob wanted these match fender stratocaster kind like using gm part chevelle if own fender want spend just few bucks feel good gift yourself buy these love color texture too they don slip or move around play read all reviews bought pairs these based reviews so put these gibson les paul last night played few hours didn hammer strings just played easy mostly eagles was hanging wall afterward took quick look at strings was shocked see high e b strings were already flattened never would expected wear after just few hours light playing strings sounded great by time had them stretched enough they would hold tune they were already worn guess m going go heavier strings so m changing strings every few days these just did perform expected giving these stars being generous sets use up now damn was using light gauge thought these mediums would hold up they lasted only two hours fender 3250l bullets at least lasted few weeks going try fender gibson see how they sound m still search perfect set strings m open suggestions love little item was reluctant sticking anything nice new fender love no more hunting picks anymore when am through playing just slide pick back into holder always there when pick up placement everything though so think out before just stick your placed mine where d never rub against between amp cord inlet control knob make sure isn way your strumming or any place your body will rub against love one coming acoustic too only wood grain version match wood oh use medium picks fit easily into holder wouldn try squeeze another why gig bag anyway must item opinion will keep short price unbelievable nice three sets box these best acoustic strings market only opinion everyone has one so many will disagree an regular acoustic an acoustic electric strung both these strings made each sound like thousand dollar find most inexpensive guitars cheap strings most can be vastly improved something simple new strings really believe these strings when find good thing am hooked will use anything these anything acoustic strings everything tone feel bend what important these very light very easy fingers unlike clunky stock strings most acoustics guess they think need big think strings produce volume so some will disagree saying they break if they re too thin would rather shorter life strings getting pure beautiful rich sound than long lasting flat string thick stock strings were killing fingers these effortless play sound so sweet mellow just like an acoustic should sound again someone will chime bash me saying would put inexpensive yamaha up against guitars costing times what paid no plans changing brands now ve made string switch some say thin strings break easily should change strings often anyway can do string change over about minutes bad day worth effort don plan hammering acoustic anyway what fender m cheap either own guitars which electrics gibson les paul fender strats one american couple dillions another great find some other nice guitars acoustic just an inexpensive yamaha very nice money after changing strings sounds like an expensive martin didn take me long throw set these acoustic electric got same results stars book more if they d allow there no other options unless someone gives me set blow me away bought one cheaper guitars does job adjusts easily doesn look bad either bought these because am constantly loosing screws when change pickguards or do new builds these exactly what doctor ordered original equipment so they re right screws must every guitarist no matter what brand own they work everything these well made don strip when screwing first time if new project always drill pilot holes anyway am so glad bought these one by one they being used almost time order another set store them little sandwich bag stars needed jack plate custom stratocaster build ordered one was far better than expected very heavy duty great chrome plating at all what expected money definite quality part worthy project will be me life nothing best going including plate cheap these strings were am pleasantly surprised results achieved picked up an old cheap electric needed some work had been dropped head after repairing playing still sounded like crap so had these strings they were cheap put them only took about minutes restring was well worth effort okay am too embarrassed give brand isn gibson les paul or fender american strat damn sounds good now if didn so many guitars might keep one will probably sell make room another these were well worth few dollars spent them honestly won restring fender them ll use fender bullets these great about any electric guitars crappy strings kill great strings can make bad okay great will continue buying using these lower end guitars will spend few extra bucks high end guitars very pleasantly surprised buy one like leather ends adjust easily stays put looks like will hold up some abuse well nice strap lower tier guitars am disabled disabled vietnam vet mobility becoming more limited every winter wife bought me christmas thinking needed new hobby keep me busy during harsh winter months am so happy she did first thought was now learn how play thing am so glad she chose particular me start now own guitars even built custom guitars always get carried away new projects can already play quite well or so m told practice lot now about wanted wait until knew little something before reviewed first don know how they sell these price they do very high quality piece comparable guitars thousand dollar price range action nice low good especially beginner did find just perfect strings made world difference use light d addaro strings love tone feel yamaha solid wood everywhere no laminate d expect price tone fantastic finish flawless tough sounds great gently playing or really getting down rough been strumming vigorously over four months now mark been playing many other guitars all electric well am looking at high end acoustic now will always keep first there no reason me need another acoustic just will because can yamaha has great tuners stays tune well rarely having make an adjustment once strings stretched neck nice though bit thick so cheat sometimes thumb low e set up was perfect just can see where going take much if any maintenance over years other than replacing strings needed yamaha came great hard case tuner pics other goodies package was very inexpensive did put nice soft leather strap quick disconnect there no front strap button no big deal there if re looking nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing would be great place start see these selling used what paid mine new so re bot going lose money either read other reviews really nice value still only acoustic own other guitars all electrics or project guitars do eye martin though plus stars one if re considering buy will regret still play almost every day these fantastic unique picks love hologram effect cute babes well always nice conversation item these little ones age great show off your guy friends love them they re good quality picks too so will use them nice small amp delivers nice pure sound at more than loud enough levels me one thing like about amp very simple bunch complicated settings worry about another thing think nicest looking amp about amps now about same size little fender frontman sits side by side living room use fender electric behringer acoustic practicing if re looking no frills amp doesn cost lot or take up much room good one makes great little practice amp am totally happy one see no need add an additional acoustic amp mine looks lot different than photo more brown actually looks better thought was buying footer realize ordered footer too late let be honest here what good foot amp chord unless re sitting amp bad never would ordered costs same money footers does footers would recommend buying footer unless practice closet seems be nice rugged stand much better than one received ordered went together fast well padded cradles well seems be solid m sure how much will use now discovered wall hangers or string swings prefer hanging them wall having them floor way just preference suppose these would be good mic night or doing gig don expect will ever be something do unless get lot better than am now still suck m having fun trying if own an american strat or tele must neck your prize love proudly states origin corona california classic fender name scribed wonderful these all three fenders again these should really come standard all american strats am revising previous review 3250l now only had these american stratocaster two weeks loved them so much at first ordered other sets restrung several other strats other guitars big mistake why am so impatient these were unbelievable right out box bring strat life giving an unbelievable feel sound every positive there usually negative wait wait yup there was changed pickguards only two weeks after installing strat noticed all three smaller strings g b e were all flat fret side they were already worn out suspected something sound had changed already too becoming flat after only about week mu only now total rotate playing so bet hadn played strat more than6 hours or so now m so disappointed m going step up then if love sound don want change strings every week make long story short wouldn buy these again unfortunately search goes perfect set strings some reason one just doesn hit notes right looks like should tune more precise than other models tone way off mine anyway tried several times just doesn tune right then recheck other brand even close maybe just got bad one like one shuts off automatically again way off tune did like style size color doesn work right so like running flat tire amp cable perfect fits need practicing just right length sitting couch strumming daily would like one each amp own so m always taking from amp amp will buy some more these cable also looks nice completes fender look would highly recommend give no brainer star rating nothing negative say about don know why quality instruments don come bone nuts these very inexpensive improvement next time change your strings check see if your current nut plastic if so few these hand re place nut will hear difference they don wear out like plastic just make certain get height correct so your action isn too high rule thumb grind just bit at time keep checking correct height can always remove more material can put back quick easy improvement bone all guitars after reading many review yamaha acoustic owned played months finally took advice other consumers many people suggested changing stock plastic nut bridge saddle improve tone an incredible deal piece way was did put light set d addario strings made world difference was due another string change so upgraded set bone nut saddle wow really did make huge difference such quality piece especially money string bone upgrades can imagine sweeter sounding acoustic changed tone classical am so happy changes high notes pure ring nicely lows rich deep sustain drastic improvement each note lasting nicely into next am so pleased excited if own or any other acoustic plastic nut saddle change them very quick fix find nice set strings love assortment every color size ll ever need can never enough picks batch should keep going while was an exceptional value picks nice quality would buy again or recommend anyone use medium picks so would search large batch these medium only though definitely star purchase first review was knee jerk reaction amp had no manual couldn get sound like wanted was so wrong giving only stars must now rerate star amp does almost too much money only wish manual came really need spend some serious time playing see depth thing has can do anything sound any way want too wow never knew could sound like actually gives any sound or personality want am beginning love thing will surely be favorite amp when totally figure out if ever do sound production endless there so many setting different combinations settings so short forgive me sinned judged too early buy thing give yourself some time yourself if looking small plug play amp isn re looking powerful sound endless possibilities growing me wouldn part now

305	 ve been playing over years currently own or so guitars problem lp they feel like boat anchor around your neck ve bought sold quite few another problem real lp only get one chance drop one just see how many used ones head stock repairs they beautiful guitars comfy me play deal used guitars picked up an epi special ll along several other guitars at resale shop very cheap didn mess until was ready set up resale fully expect do fret level most guitars even lot higher end guitars need found special ll frets were actually very well done chinese version from only needed slight leveling would played fine without am very picky didn take much get set up small truss rod adjustment new set strings little bit adjustment bridge cut nut bit note played well way got just like stuff perfect got set up plugged check electronics when started really become impressed cheap pickups supposed sound muddy no character these sounded pretty good actually very good nice bright nice tight bottom end check sound also by cranking up backing track stage level playing few tracks cut through really well noticed while doing test volume had very nice sweep didn lose any highs when turned down tone knob was also very usable good sweep very nice popped off back cover check what was there full sized pots maybe best quality much better than expected normally upgrade electronics personal guitars get controls operate way like no need fix what broken yup said personal guitars because am keeping one myself neck very fast comfy boat anchor so shoulder will thank me tuners lower end trapezoid type turn smoothly no backlash keep tune fine once again if ain broke don fix please note most tuning problems from binding improperly cut nut ve set up hundreds guitars almost all them need nut work doesn matter what price point at also has bolt neck lot players say set glued neck feel glue actually deadens sound bit prefer good solid bolt transfer sound imo found quality level low end foreign guitars has become very good know corners be cut get price point these budget guitars all all special ll good go right out box just little tweaking advice go try one taste may be same yours there lot good value well made guitars now days just found at price vs quality ratio epiphone special ll really special get one get set up few bucks if can do yourself will good instrument oh did mention very good looking was buying pawn shop when paying they handed me amp stated came didn expect actually use what heck could sell make bit money back got home set up new pawn shop plugged into frontman just see if worked was surprised find out only did work sounded very good own deluxe reverb all tube amp little frontman had fender sound what really was impressive was reverb went from nice echo full fledge drippy surf sound actually took few small gigs did very well normally use blues jr small gigs frontman did fine job some smaller gigs when all need little reverb just plug straight into amp worked well plenty volume smooth reverb plus small easy back all all very impressed decided keep would easily pay full retail nice little amp might even see if can squeeze inch speaker into very nice bridge was an oem part so didn come screws springs claw or tremolo bar just bridge itself best price was killer deal block full size probably zinc or some mystery metal vintage bent saddles would be good replacement an older mim strat smaller block or other asian import or just replace one wore out like stated was dirt cheap decent quality got mine trade practically nothing figured could sell make few bucks saw mustang amp around never gave any credibility looked like toy me anyway decided plug was shocked at full sound little inch speaker researched found there program called fuse can interface amp downloaded linked amp there saw can make lot changes can be done just knobs saw had deluxe reverb setting deluxe reverb reissue so dialed same settings fuse software amazement sound like smaller version deluxe fender really got close modeling went ahead programmed few more patches set up footswitch change between settings liked so much went out bought mustang ii almost like mustang better ii does enough power gig if aren loud band will leave deluxe reverb at home next small gig use mustang maybe even little one mic up ordered epi jr because had one years ago son adopted his own missed having one saw tv yellow had came well packed looked much better person than pics website was set up very well among few guitars purchased were playable out box fret work top notch finish good some very slight blems if play like should ll add some your own there was slight binding nut most people think tuners right away most tuning problems at nut quick fix some pencil lead or chap stick will fix up if can make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite tech when hear pinging sound when tuning nut issue only thing did was lower bridge bit thing plays like dream plugged sounds good can get lot different sounds simple use volume tone picking closer neck or bridge varies your sound play close bridge tone wide open puts tele territory while using volume clean things up or add some dirt sound add some tone knob pick closer neck get into blues region will make more versatile player absence neck pickup reduces magnetic pull strings lets them ring out sustain very good result could carry forever get idea ve been player years collector half own many vintage guitars including gibson fender gretsch most pleasure from playing newer imports quality superb most recent ones tone snobs may laugh new epi les paul jr plays just well most anything out there

310	 great build quality works like should feels comfortable wear also no complaints at all great color also considering shade green d sweet strap similar one has blue fire these very durable straps won fall off your so can play confidently they little bit stiff side where can be kinda uncomfortable at times expected since new blue fire strap from dunlop comfortable now since ve used awhile so get better use besides being uncomfortable at first an awesome strap would recommend anyone has an awesome amp there so many settings amp could spend hours news sounds effects so sick fun experimenting different effects mixing them something new sometime want get pedal amp preset effects like great amp if re just looking something either mess around or practice play lot different songs electric guitars amp makes really fun would recommend beginner an advanced player
311	 axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g320squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing years had squier bullet was cheap didn care about could keep next couch play rocksmith got old wore frets out so needed new cheap rocksmith picked up lp special black at center they kicked free strings bought game soon found myself using more than other guitars because sounded so good played so well had killer tone lp studio had pickups replaced zakk wylde which made good metal lost some bluesy tone passives imagine delight when inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone playability considering thing almost same prices bullet squier easily twice price literally cannot find better than special sound 5two passive humbuckers great sound glossy highs deep lows they put just right amount dirt tone gutsy clean or distorted sound pickups were wax dipped did microphone feedback effect pickups high output feel like alnico more than ceramic sure which they so much sustain bolt neck was shocked build quality 5i did problem high e tuner didn notice store string peg was up out headstock when discovered loosened string whacked fret hammer popped right stayed way intonation required no adjustment action was exactly way like itneck was straight no fret buzz or excessive bow finish was perfect no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness neck was flush no gaps or seams professionally shimmed damn good bolt hardware typical price does job stays tune very well back bending headstock 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable bridge similar lp studio tunamatic setup individual strings may be intonated action done two nuts ie can raise one side higher or lower individual strings weird having toggle between volume knobs soon got used no pickguard doesn need one lots relief between strings body won find yourself hitting pickup housings or body pick makes easy clean too truss rod behind nice body color plate frets were smooth rounded played nice could use little buffing silky smooth rough neck plays fast nut took some getting used would catch hand when fretting at top soon got used wasn an issue 500k pots side body trplug keeps cable out way overall 5came hex keys setupcame an awsome poster all epiphone modelscame nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed foam shroud foam blocks about same any other summary best bang buck any instrument own sounds good enough gig out box well built plays well if treat well should give years great music frets medium jumbo little deeper than fender meaning they should last longer before needing re fretting than typical affinity or bullet squiers price range would say suitable all styles music did blues metal country pop pickups humbuckers which means they darker higher output than fender much those nice fender bell like tones chime makes up power clarity one thing like about epiphones gibsons volume pot close bridge makes very easy palm mute play high gain lay pinky knife edge hand lightly across strings right where they hit bridge makes nice mute strats damn volume knob way an experiment took pick up pole scews out bottom pickup see if could get single coil sound out what happened was mess because parafin wax which got everywhere tone was little brighter output little lower still no hum wouldn fool anyone into thinking was single coil ended up putting screws back will likely put lp studio stock pickups back hell yeah coil tapping here come move emg lp special make myself nice little metal do yourself favor buy even if already better cheap enough won care if bang around little good enough will enjoy playing many years cheaply made thin leather leave lot be desired at least long enough even lowest slung postures should accomadate bass well due extra length am comparing center straps which double leather ends which much sturdier than ones ernie ball strap which thin single ply wouldn trust strap without strap lock winder makes loud ear piercing squeaking when winding fast tried unscrewing putting little oil screw head didn make much difference hope goes away use string cutter works like champ was using set flush cut nips they kept getting bent trying cut hard nickel steel strings these work much better they don cut string they shear off ve done sets strings no noticable wear cutter drop replacment many fenders installed these fender marauder needed drill holes head stock can see really well picture there metal plug bottom next screw hole needs hole fit into sweat some bullets used smallest drill bit own stuck piece tape 1mm from tip so wouldn drill too deep important make hole straight line from screw hole so they don go crooked also had drill screw holes about 2mm deeper because screws come go deeper into headstock now they re installed can attest holds tune better easier tune before would respond many pegs until twisted too far then would suddenly break lose be too sharp flat happens far less now guitars cramped little bedroom studio quickly ran out space hold them easily floor space dominated by desk drum set wanted guitars be out way safe so they didn get tripped over or dinged enter string swing them hung everything from fender bass takamine acoustic no trouble y headstock holder pivots accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like stratocaster just slip your headstock into weight finds own center gravity base plate an attractive open wood grain looks like hickory didn use supplied wall anchors instead drilled directly into wall studs these well worth cost oil what more do want turn upside down squeeze hard use your man level strength soon tip will darken apply liberally your fret board back forth motion immediately wipe your fret board clean just take wet look away let sit few hours then dry rest way rubbing cloth okay soak wood long momentary don saturate fretboard walk away wood absorbs oil too much oil absorbed fretboard wood becoming swollen buckling losing shape flatness good situation lemon oil isn like other oils isn very slippery kind makes things grabby oil actually works more like solvent cleaning things making them sqeaky clean like your frets hint hint just be sure buff off all excess put little string lubricant your frets before re string ll be happy camper they were little too much squier bullet put them even truss rod maxed out they bowed neck while had em though they played well bent relatively easy their thickness more metal moving over pickup hotter sound more gain stratocaster more glass bell like tones ve used ernie ball slinky line strings almost exclusively decades they never break they stay tune after stretching they sound great lots harmonics make textured musical sound fun fact get yourself mandrel sizing rings can turn your old strings into custom made jewlery there something be said giving pretty ring used make pretty sound ringing out your amplifier little silver lead free solder hold several windings together then buffed they look excellent love these things feel little guilty because put pair epiphone les paul plus top also them fender marauder now can easily swap straps between guitars m secure knowledge going land foot yeah could put one those plastic dunlop pick looking things regular strap keep place these look feel so much cooler they use quick connect kind found natural gas compressed air connectors pull up locking ring slide release good inexpensivecontains most hardware need drum mounts etc works or 8has carrying casethe kick mic has good low frequency responsethe bad has locking clasps included keys too big key holes does contain any cabling will easily spend much did microphonesno instructions how use mounts or little things like can use plyers remove adapters from mountskick mic needs mic stand one providedthe ugly two condenser microphones incredibly sensitive at cost an incredibly high noise floor there ton hiss at any level setting will make your recording sound like casette tape unless eq out all highs condensers kill hissssss

time before gets broken if taken out house or road far better off purchasing cheap snark tuner if lost or broken wouldn be big deal replace accurate enough most peoples use purchased pedal at local music store practice possibly doing some loops at open mics roland which has flawless basic looper built only seconds record no undo had hoped would at least last one hour battery so wouldn need carry power adapter along factory battery lasted about hour second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about minutes started recording loop another 3rd fresh battery tested v multimeter unit started behaving erratically after few seconds recording suggesting was faulty lights started coming off randomly record undo all three together then off then undo then all three etc etc first time used jamman xt factory battery seemed be working ok all can say basic looper sucked am used synching loops other loopers timing everything so know was poor technique main problem was didn matter how hard tried even if did manual fade out there was always gap about seconds between end loop start makes unit useless also poorly conceived replace battery take out screws exposing delicate printed circuit board potential damage here very high also replacing screws needs be done very carefully avoid cross threading screws messing up receiver nuts which mounted directly onto circuit board save few dollars digitech did foresight manufacture unit battery box which would protected electronics possible read inevitable damage owned quite few digitech products over years generally they well thought out well constructed they really dropped ball one going back store where purchased

332	 first let me start by saying pedal has been part setup nearly years now still looks sounds great day came out box its boss product which means going pay what get get best bang your buck boss products solid rugged construction built last no chance breaking one these things an outstanding analog stomp box genuine sound good customer support well if ever feel need sale your boss pedal resale prices always good while pedal capable hundreds tones sounds chorus one most useful versatile effects opinion here some best uses found tweak pedal just thicken your sound give effect perfect if want fatten up really heavy chorus song make sound really full dime out speed depth those crazy out world korn type effects really handy pedal imitating tones other bands because can do so much there lot bands tones can come close exactly matching tones took them or pedals achieve liquify your sound give beautiful tone cleans leads pedal will help simple parts would normally go unoticed stand out if play any kind christian music will soon learn doesn matter what do long put chorus walking sunday morning turn out some slayer while using chorus pedal they will go nuts chorus just one those effects no matter what type music playing will always find use so there no excuse adding pedal your rig addition some great features easy access battery compartment accepts 9v power supply works well both bass out puts so can run sources if desired all controls need really be complete control get pedal first all want say love tube amp distortion overdriven tubes just how its meant be run randall g3 hybrid amp destroys any solid state ve used or heard recording use peavey its so sweet tubes how was meant be heard recently started playing band required dirty tone felt like could only be achieved through pedal there absolutely nothing wrong using distortion pedals used dod death metal years when first started playing however there downside go cheap get piece crap makes your rig sound like an old am radio if want something sounds pro quality your going shell out at least quality dist pedals budget friendly chose mt because know boss makes quality product was pedal other guitarist was using gives variety sounds can be set up an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones controls make very tweakable gotten load very nice sounds out read included book look up some mp3s over videos online check out other guitarists settings will help tame pedal into what want perfect pedal those wanting spend whole lot there also mods can buy install pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers open up even more shaping make more useful ve seen lot complaints about pedal sounding like nothing fuzz must say learn how shape sound spend time dialing your rig within minutes was pleased mt used overdrive channel push harder got really thick heavy distortion good response say mt worth an investment if re looking big distortion sound from little pedal surely something guitarists should consider adding their board oh its crybaby crybaby wah suck because don own crybaby m tired hearing these statements from guitarists so fresh they couldn even tell how many strings their instrument has wah pedal just doesn cut maybe at one time today hasn been up par long time young player insisted having wah pedal mom bought me one thought was awesome until learned better took me about week learn how turn when finally did thought broke eq pedal isn good there no smooth transition from heel toe there big drop freq kills effect pump your foot really fast avoid having drop pretty much push toe foward then literally stomp turn then follow same steps turn off very inconvenient someone who trying rapidly move between effects board can say its just complete piece junk does give wah effect classic pedal there better out now so why we still stuck stone age thing even had someone mod mine while gave little more headroom fixed dropping issue still had slam turn off still sounded like cheap wah suggestion mark tremonti wah great kicks things end when comes range simplicity use may cost more will probably end up hating crybaby getting one anyway so just go tremonti power wah begin what use wah digitech rp250 processor may say cheap processor ve been using years haven seen anyone can tell price based sound quality thats what matters why suggest wah can control sensitivity how hard press your toe down turn mine set fairly light can totally shape your tone right there board very easily even presets crybaby being one them can get an entire processor full effects an awesome wah little bit more if want cheap child gimic type toy want get serious about wah spit every crybaby see go elsewhere little story back these lock integrity installed them korean made washburn wg 587v incredible after tweaking did spin at show went flying strap lock was still strap locked into holder screw had ripped out horn screw tore through about half inch solid wood epoxy all screws before strap lock broke amazing nice tough hardware only complaint must use screws small heads if choose use stock screws provided easy install just unscrew your stock strap holder screw lock holder attach lock your strap bam quick release system fast take off your would suggest getting tough thick leather strap nice reinforced eye install quick release button cheap lightweight straps will eventually start tear also button can be slight pain get certain straps now switched over dimarzio clip lock straps instead leather straps dunlop locks many reasons am very happy product grade always felt secure these straplocks our bass player uses some expensive heavy fender basses he loves these strap locks

338	 really pains me give anything star review boss product since m such big fan their product line build quality overall those compliments apply equally cs compression sustainer does do job reasonably well without me having worry about putting less reliable brand signal chain however there some minor issues pedal need know two most common complaints see adds noise your amp changes tone bit former complaint probably true though if re enough hobbyist use compression sustainer re probably already contemplated using noise gate suppressor such boss ns problem solved latter complaint changes tone also true necessarily bad thing if like tone results whole point cs supposed cut out extremes your tone sustain can result muddy neutered tone though can play tone other settings help also find settings all at o clock output too quiet compared other pedals at default settings really while boss pedals considered be expensive compared many other effects out there cs should really be viewed budget or entry level compressor when consider most quality compressors either rack units or something like keeley compressor costing north best thing can say about boss even compared similarly priced mxr options cs gives great deal control over your compression reasonable price biggest negative pedal opinion resulting sound might seem little too compressed there lot things could do cs works best paired other pedals chorus delay some distortions re trying smooth out ultimately pedal could been better though there aren too many significantly better alternatives until get north anyway there some element nostalgia ds ve just never understood know they re cheap know they re incredibly durable all boss pedals know everybody had one or tried one at some point kurt cobain apparently used them his fenders also know ve almost never been happy tone get when step pedal incredibly thin harsh lacks proper sustain even cranked all way ve used marshall solid state amps vox tube amps fender single coil pickups guitars humbuckers can mess tone dist dials all want there has be dozens other affordable pedals even amp distortion richer deeper tone coincidentally also used boss os2 overdrive distortion many years which supposedly merges blends ds an od pedal isn ideal either if turn knob all way distortion much better tone than ever got out ds then again very dependable usually only or less so can really give bad review because probably does belong everyone collection just doesn mean ll want use all time held out from trying boss sd super overdrive many years like many guitarists first distortion pedal was boss ds which was durable aggressive also extremely frustrating might formed some negative impressions about boss when was probably unfair do so sd widely owned very affordable usually around similar lot ways ibanez ts tubescreamer except tubescreamer reissue costs twice much lot guitarists consider sd be more rock overdrive while ts more tube blues effect there probably some truth both them excellent pedals however sd really impressed me its transparency versatility can simply plug into use alone clean channel isn necessarily best use pedal excels booster pushing an already overdrive amp or stacking other distortion od pedals one best settings turning level all way up gain all way down adds just little bit grit your tone really sounds great feel lot people give sd mediocre reviews reasons aren fair hear things like cuts out too much bass when really what pedal supposed do midrange hump when set up properly can take away muddiness your tone help cut through band during live playing like said before feel if more transparent retaining elements clean tone than ts though preference between two entirely subjective also know boss pedal which means durable they come thing will stand up years abuse can be used any number roles if re looking single pedal make small amp sound big there probably better options range try under appreciated md mega distortion or excellent joyo ultimate drive if understand what pedal supposed do use purpose ll understand why thing has been popular over years acknowledge minority opinion perhaps just had bad luck unit attempts repair afterwards while loved sound functionality wah wah pedal would literally last me few months at time before became unusable suspected potentiameter was shot so had replaced same problems reoccurred like horrible static noise soon started using good product hopefully they make them more durable than particular unit had didn think d be compelled review something like pick dunlop ultex has really impressed me thus far use thickness which equivalent orange plastic dunlop pick orange pick favorite acoustic most electric playing they do wear down fray edges little more friction d like ultex seems very resistant wear has surprisingly little drag over string find matte finish very easy grip hold gives just enough use smooth strumming while being rigid enough individual notes some reviewers noted they crack after some use if turns out be problem might reconsider review out box they perform well any pick used first all don expect any new tuner work drop replacement drop replacements tuners basically don exist unless exact type tuner case aren doing an upgrade ll likely need bore out additional diameter peg hole drill press or tapered reamer or if there center or shop nearby tech do work these tuners arrived quickly very attractive nice vintage look they would look great either strat or tele unfortunately squier bullet had slightly smaller headstock which meant low e string tuner was too large wing screw hung over edge therefore will be installing these fault tuner functionally these one easiest tuning keys rotate ve heard hold tune just fine check back your headstock fit if go these great option if listen or read what many pro guitarists techies say about digitech effects pedals they ll tell stay away from them except one because digitech bad monkey tube overdrive an incredible value could go head head any pedal made by boss or ts tubescreamer fact ts tubescreamer pedal bad monkey best compared meant be heavy distortion pedal endless game simulates overloaded tube amp adds crunch little gain an otherwise clean tone notes will sing chords will really crunch especially blues classic rock since pedal works well level gain boost ve heard guitarists turning bad monkey conjunction other distortion effects really push them new levels best feature bad monkey by far two band eq virtually any distortion pedal has tone control will make tone darker or brighter since one band eq basically takes away bass add treble or vice versa may find sound want what so great about bad monkey if feel like your tone too weak can fatten up if too muddy can add treble can make those changes without compromising parts tone like construction extremely durable die cast metal probably heavier than boss pedal switch more similar boss than an ibanez pedal find easier use if re beginning player or player budget would be an outstanding pedal own along more traditional high gain distortion pedal there really no need spend extra money tubescreamer if will prevent from buying something else need your gear even player where money an object don overlook bad monkey might just be only tube overdrive pedal ll need reviews item there seems be lot debate over what fender mini tone master how we should evaluate toy or meant be serious bedroom amplifier do we review compared only other mini amps or do other small combos costing under creep into discussion well bought one myself conclusion isn best way practice quietly at home also also fun little product at an affordable price sounds slightly better than d expect appearance durability actually aesthetics mini tone master one favorite things about conversation piece wouldn mind having out work desk reminder one favorite hobbies just so happens functioning amplifier can plug into practice also component actually used make amplifier cheap yet put together convincing way take step back d swear hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather grill cloth over speakers nice facade hard plastic facing protects speakers actually while amp cheap also fairly durable fact just dumped off desk reaching over write review seems be working fine phew should also be noted amp powered either by 9v battery or 9v dc adapter boss pedal supply adapter will work example while battery option obviously nice portability red light seemed noticeably dimmer 9v can say how long battery will last if plan one place most time adapter preferred way go sound concept amp pretty ridiculous if think about one watt output twin speakers given each speaker smaller than tweeter large stereo speaker won be surprised at all hear there virtually no bass sound sounds like poor 10w solid state amp only shrunk down few inches at same time kind remarkable feat miniature amplifier puts out fair amount sound opted mini tone master over some other options because actually has fair range tones low gain high volume produces pretty good clean tones humbuckers gain turned up can get bit raunchy unfortunately tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally haven figured out which yet had at most time didn seem cut much treble turned up actually got brightest around then almost became more muffled beyond again mini amp expectations were much begin do like four knobs decision make power knob same size other knobs was subtle touch prevents cheaper feel an off flat toy switch expected speaker overdrive break up if pushed too hard tube like manner wasn necessarily case there other problems something internally rattles after volume goes above speaker being overpowered common issue cheap amps might even pop open see what rattling around sound quality isn objectively good by any means good enough play amplified electric hear basic characteristics your instrument playing style alternatives primary reason rated instead really isn any issues above am happy amp limited usefulness compared many alternatives home quiet practicing favorite these by far vox amplugs which headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers sound quality those things pump into your headphones far greater quality volume fullness than anything mini amp could do also they offered at or so simply better value another alternative plug into smartphone practice software while sound quality volume often problem smartphone apps possibilities effects modeling recording endless if think about recent improvements small size bluetooth speakers realize sound quality device size could be far better than what mini tone master offers at same time those speakers can cost up premium sound quality was never point amp your opinion will depend your expectations if don take too seriously cool little device book anything allows practice more than would otherwise nothing laugh at ve had pedal since mid when started playing teens while an eq might seem like an odd choice beginner pedal selection was mainly trying compensate crappy bass mid range cheap crate marshall amps used back then since better equipment now haven used much however simple definitely useful tool can leave all time mold your sound greater detail than most amps would knobs or can board volume crank up volume solos or louder parts only negatives recall from using were added bit hissing noise so much couldn trap noise gate seemed take away from sustain notes just bit again nothing can be fixed other effects if think about how important equalization stereo equipment only makes sense might want level control amp well give despite minor flaws because does what says boss products built rock solid ll thing forever first off great classic pedal has shaped tones rock blues artists all over musical map actually reissue pedals ibanez made though there some debate over whether or modern circuitry retains all original tone opinion unless re being purposefully picky or most elite trained ears would never be able tell difference construction sturdy metal actually heavier feeling than boss pedal led light some reason difficult see from an angle largely an irrelevant gripe let be clear what tube overdrive pedal isn distortion petal like boss ds or metal zone mt also fuzz pedal like would hear jimi hendrix song meant heavy rock metal grunge type music if need heavy distortion mask sloppy playing ts9 what does do however boost signal at front end which essentially results more dynamic done additional gain can result very midrange heavy blues tone stevie ray vaughan used quite bit or even nice crunch overdrive tone ac dc rhythm work some guitars use simply boost their signal without adding bunch additional gain also works well other distortion pedals purpose long story short ibanez ts9 tubescreamer really one more versatile pedals will use just don expect create every range sounds need right out box cheaper alternative consider digitech surprisingly good bad monkey overdrive pedal which half price gives more control over tone ve also compared boss bd blues driver which an excellent very different style overdrive bd has much hotter output more aggressive tubescreamer more subtle works midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone responding picking style if start good amp setup tubescreamer will sound great won completely transform your tone will give your current tones boost make those solos really sing those rhythm chords really crunch picked up pedal used along ds keeley modded distortion pedal entirely knowing what think long story short mod ds getting returned m keeping fulltone ocd first word about negative reviews tells something when small handfull people completely trash something other reviews sept were all star reviews tells me people who ripped tone pedal didn know what pedal was before they tried anyone complaining about price hand crafted pedal extremely well constructed inside circuitry pristine built last decades think ratings should reflect quality first foremost now let talk about how pedal sounds marketed an overdrive distortion had lot people try steer me away from because indicated was looking distortion pedal was actually quite surprised at how much gain sustain pedal has much more an overdrive sense keeps tonal characteristics your amp boosts level gain very full rich sound sound has lot bass unlike tubescreamer ts definitely muddy fact if re tired distortion pedals sounding tinny weak combo act might be exactly what need battery accessible behind hand screws moderately involved get an ac adapter really way go standard plug like find boss ibanez pedals can use 9v or 18v ve read some reviewers say 18v gives more headroom while some actually prefer 9v sound honestly tried both didn discern any difference probably only matters at very loud volumes cabinets finally there an lp hp switch really matter preference setup how use ve been mostly using lp setting which has plenty output avoids shrill highs hate live setting or use boost soloing hp setting could be quite useful designed emphasize mids highs cut through other instruments stage if had summarize pedal would describe tubescreamer can rock which say better than tubescreamer necessarily definitely has larger range gain tone put your pedalboard may find yourself using your go rhythm chord sections soloing or both guitars largely stay at home so they don require heavy duty protection large hard case hard cases almost always cost dollars or more also take up about twice much room which problematic storing multiple instruments most cases good soft gig bag padding should protect your instrument against light bumps bangs costs about price hard case bought two different variations fender gig bag believe one pictured here one has fender medium picks zipper handles which cool touch case fits fender squier strat guitars or other guitars similar size snugly there ton padding more than might think from pictures especially top pocket fine there variety adjustable handles straps can say zippers will withstand years use most uses they should do just fine glad an affordable option protect guitars much say about chrome neckplate largely cosmetic item old one serial number was corroding pretty bad liked look new one few people mentioned thinner assuming also pad underneath which should was problem me at all anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened screws installation took all minutes neck set up exactly was before looks great bought vox amplug ac30 loved so much probably doubled or tripled amount time play loved so much went out got more expensive by joe satriani signature amplug liked satriani model also because covered different tonal range than ac30 delay feature lot fun had serious questions about classic rock amplug why did only star review amazon among lowest any fabulous amplug products would be only one trick pony well tell was completely blown away by how great classic rock amplug m now even more blown away by some these negative reviews ve tried out number effects pedals plugging into an actual amplifier many pedal users seeking what they call marshall box other words they want effects pedal will single handedly transform whatever amp they into sound miniaturized stack marshalls believe or vox classic rock higher gain settings about close marshall sound can imagine comes small plastic headphone amplifier runs aaa batteries costs all functionally classic rock amplug same ac30 three dials gain tone volume an aux jack mp3 players headphone jack an off switch where similarities end while excellent ac30 model simulates boxy sparkly sound tube amplifier classic rock packs some punch low end presence thing even through set entry level sony headphones from target significantly greater than ac30 more importantly sound doesn deteriorate higher volumes there plenty ways can try play through headphones most them become static filled mess soon turn up volume amazingly tiny amplug has plenty power tap overdrive controlled through analog circuitry amazing clarity real surprise classic rock amplug point upon which disagree several other reviewers here clean slightly overdrive tones roll back gain knob several reviewers referred clean tones weak or claimed there were no clean tones yet both les paul strat was able set volume at around gain at about level get very nice clean tone without loss volume if any dirt was remaining slight rollback volume further cured problem even better playing strat into classic rock gain set somewhere between actually created tubescreamer like blues tone tone was one audio demos offered vox website didn believe myself until plugged classic rock dialed tone long story short classic rock extremely powerful more verstaile than thought can do high gain marshall tones expected also offers wide array clean or slightly overdriven tones might even be more versatile than ac30 amplug though remain pretty loyal ac30 good news two models different enough cheap enough can own both highly recommend classic rock stars korg pitchblack probably along boss tu tu considered one industry standards compact pedal bypass tuners use bass both tu pitchblack excellent don really an opinion yet which better however there some strengths korg pitchblack may lead prefer over other tuners primary draw here bright light up display wide color bars tuner displays note closest colors guide perfect pitch marked by green light middle almost like an airplane landing guide only do lights indicate tone by turning off they actually dim transition into one another go across those semi tones could argue therefore visual guide giving lot more precision than would get from simple off light tuner works quickly reliably build quality outstanding true bypass when step pedal tuner signal off switch also soft button variety similar what find some vox pedals many boutiques has nice feel though could be easier bump if high traffic area great tuner at reasonable price really comes down user preference ve heard many guitarists prefer one because its high accuracy visibility actually first experience biyang pedal heard good things about build quality didn end up biyang until needed reverb pedal turns out reverb relatively expensive effect find compact pedal most popular options or up at around tri reverb has distinct advantage price don underestimate its quality some other reviewers noted reverb can get extremely deep lush if so desire found myself blend time knobs around practical spring reverb there multi switch hall spring room there subtle differences between three d be lying if said they sounded dramatically different b switch isn well explained if re mode effect much more dramatic found operating b mode was similar type reverb had enjoyed amps note has stereo input output only use one input output so can comment at end day fairly simple always effect biyang does job without costing fortune what makes star worthy book little pieces attention quality having thumb mini screw open 9v compartment instead plastic door or needing phillips screwdriver big deal also love 9v jack top unit away from other jacks pots smooth easy turn mini switches footswitch boutique level quality great reverb pedal don think ll ever need another one received gift smaller pedalboard was assembling plan was try something different compare against boss ns noise suppressor other board while love build quality simplicity one knob setup can say yet like better than ns caveat may wired up correctly felt did kill most excess noise all good product maybe best all options at same price will update post after play around different arrangements get more experience recently picked up tc electronic mojomojo overdrive at steal price m evaluating based its inherent quality relative retail price own many different overdrives including light overdrives tubescreamer some ones capable getting bit more raucous blues driver ocd joyo ultimate drive etc me closer tubescreamer family does better clean boost or light overdrive actually separate knobs bass treble its darker tone remind me bit digitech bad monkey build quality outstanding has an mxr style click button press mechanism feels sturdy built last 9v jack top out way o jacks battery compartment opens unique oversized flat screw button can easily get open your fingers or maybe quick turn screwdriver thing dense build solid rock always appreciate extra weight pedals because lighter ones less crush resistant tend get around by your cables finally knobs built will some force feedback several them actually notched settle into position which nice touch tone quality obviously tone quality most subjective part review would be at all critical reviewer who gave absolutely loved several previous reviewers did based pedals used experiences mojomojo feels more like me tone very warm almost point being muddy whether mod switch boost or cut pedal bassier up position don get me wrong definitely appreciate abundance low end frequencies might get some tweaking get high end shine through could also easily see getting lost mix if play other instruments does nice job adding bit gain saturation your tone without coloring too much different character however if d like similar effect much more expressive brighter output try mad professor sweet honey overdrive or its clone companion joyo sweet baby overdrive ease use versatility many overdrives only single tone control so was excited see controls bass treble still feel like pedal could be great some amps very muddy others will update review if feelings change few different combinations want try out feel preferred use pedal stacked overdrive pushing some other type overdrive or distortion much way would use tubescreamer will say one more tube like overdrives tried hit notes lightly get clean transparent tone attack them harder higher output from will push overdrive cause further breakup much like tube amp however if your hope simply plug into mojomojo into clean amp expect classic rock tones may be bit disappointed standalone overdrive pedal wanted review pedal because felt some other reviews were little lukewarm distortion incredibly subjective depends your rig your tastes badass by mxr very nice pedal decent price doesn do metal or super high gain offers some nice classic rock tones can be quite warm if back off tone knob crunch button adds brightness volume may or may be too harsh your setup however tone knob does do pretty good job rolling back high end especially if activate crunch button build quality seems be pretty good though should note while pedal same size other mxr pedals significantly lighter suppose could make more susceptible denting damage if travels should be plenty durable users really like switch one too easy press clearly clicks once depressed one minor annoyance if use crunch setting blue light which annoyingly bright like an led headlight stays even when pedal itself off can be quite distracting if rely lights your pedal board tell which effects really major gripe detracts from pedal quality frustrating design decision basically if get right setup ll get great tone got pedal specifically try find better alternative boss ds which lacks mids can sound harsh abrasive mxr badass definitely superior regard lot will depend your rig settings find pedal really excels playing single notes lower strings think walk way by aerosmith or hangingaround intro by counting crows if pair fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal could probably thicken up bit higher solos great pedal most guitarists tremolo very simple effect simply want pedal control swells or oscillations volume give your tone shimmering effect used subtle fashion everything from rock surf modern indie rock most guitarists like me were never going shell out or more boss or other expensive tremolo option fact there really weren many affordable tremolo pedals market enter joyo jf tremolo pedal simple durable affordable just works only two controls intensity depth volume swells rate how fast swells cycle led light dims rhythmically along rate control which nice visual indicator sound pedal sounds great doesn color or diminish your tone any way m tremolo expert effect sounds should if re type obsess over tremolo then probably aren looking save money anyway there boutique options from catalinbread others tap input other features m particularly interested those so lack those joyo won detract from score regarding quality durability joyo pedals there lot discussion about also some misinformation ve personally owned them at one point or another yes like them much ve yet one fail early run joyo pedals actually quite durable includes jf tremolo every pedal numbered from jf through jf more recent models numbered higher than all similar appearance while many them still sound great they feel lighter cheaper switch little more suspect recommend ordering through vendor ships from u rather than trying save few bucks direct shipment from china many u vendors will test pedal out before shipping which huge advantage highly recommended really can say enough positive things about apogee jam even years ago would considered recording into an ipad or iphone be novelty interface products most people use hook up your gimmicks or toys now we so many quality modeling programs recording daw audiobus connect them one another whether re budding professional or just hobbyist aiming record your own covers apogee jam usually around deserves serious look pros extremely easy use widely compatible no batteries required get small plastic converter an input cable one end digital output pin connector lightning or mac cables all which included virtually any serious recording app ios garageband agile ampkit amplitube jamup xt will recognize work apogee jam right out box crystal clear digital sound sound quality get through digital input markedly better than using headphone jack an input ll hear your meant be heard far less hissing junk background considerably less feedback was actually primary reason decided upgrade positive grid jamup plug wasn disappointing me sound quality there was so much additional noise went would easily cause modeling amps agile ampkit feed back high gain settings even something basic like marshall jcm900 were practically unusable even clean settings had noise filter turned way up still didn thwart feedback issues apogee jam cured all instantly when first plugged wasn even sure was because expected hear constant hissing background what assumed was fault software was actually due poor interface jam improvement avoiding feedback alone made worth its price no crosstalk when do multi track recording headphone jack splitter get bleed over effect referred cross talk basically using headphone input monitor play along your track due poor circuitry also gets fed back into armed track recording some people bothered by more than others makes quality multi track recording quite challenging haven noticed any using apogee jam whatsoever since digital connection can still monitor your playing using ipad headphone jack separately obviously gain control led gauge feature unique jam love how implemented when first plug device led light blue show hooked up being utilized by software once input active software light becomes green however play hit harder notes light may change yellow orange or even red if getting into red your input level too high may overdrive signal adjust right jam using roller dial tend aim setting where light largely green starts touch yellow only more aggressive parts works well cons price point little high admittedly wasn thrilled about having spend what was already doing headphone jack being said researched all alternatives repeatedly heard was best if knew would be good price would been little concern also there aren really any quality digital options significantly cheaper lightweight plastic design actually no problem build quality jam or made out plastic at same time fact relatively lightweight means your cable may pull off table also would advise stepping if happens fall floor they do include two velcro strips fasten problem can address common sense highly recommend apogee jam mid level priced device services everyone from complete amateurs recording professionals reviews herein indicated there wide variety uses studio monitor like m audio bx5 proper cables can hook up everything from an ipad home computer musical instrument or stereo will preface review by saying am no audiophile basic understanding speaker musical equipment primary goal here was find small speaker could use monitor playing through either preamp pedal or ipad modeling software those goals mind was pleasantly surprised how good bx5 sounded goal any studio monitor convey much true sound source material possible without coloring tone additional equalization there some monitors comparable price range like rokkit options from mackie jbl tried those out bx5 performs we well or better than hoped playing use close proximity desktop found had surprising amount low end punch woofer given fender tube amp has speaker twice size bass tight articulate which what want again if your goal just drown out sound additional base go get pair beats headphones or hook up dozen subwoofers wasn really goal all aside having enough low end was important me bx5 delivers using modeling fender vox type amplifiers also handled high end chime well without sounding tinny should note got an xlr microphone cable converts trs other side had heard read was best way get signal into thing though there likely adapters other cables could use accomplish same thing there both xlr trs inputs back monitor powered so there power cable well there volume knob no independent bass treble adjustment other monitors so if want look elsewhere if monitor actually relaying most source tone shouldn be using anyway really enjoying bx5 so far wish had budget space 2nd one ve reviewed several joyo pedals now loved almost all them just because price also because their apparent durability tone quality would be appreciated at any price ultimately decided somewhere between review just can give review ve given other joyo products ve tried out thus far extremely high output high sustain when first plugged thing had set up similar any other distortion pedal would try out les paul vox combo amp dials all at o clock big mistake pedal has an extremely high output depending gain setting was achieving output parity clean signal volume set at around isn necessarily bad thing certainly better than having no headroom set pedal louder frequent criticism boss ds something be aware also read several comments here isn high gain distortion couldn disagree more thing has tons gain think people thrown off by two things name which pays tribute mi audio crunchbox clones clarity transparency tone particularly higher end range shines through at all gain levels crunch mind refers punchy cleanish tone has just little bit breakup its character crunch distortion has tone doesn really breakup or get fizzy turn up gain what gain really gain knob increases saturation sustain note think people fooled by fact sound doesn crack up hit barre chord see how long note holds gain turned up actually makes pedal very useful lead work also which one jf strengths setup weird workable because everything described above may use some weird dial configurations get tone want level usually around still very loud crunchy classic rock tone other reviewers talked about does exist only at around gain setting had tone knob generally working from o clock o clock got little too bright go any higher again les paul humbuckers ultimately what decided was pedal has enough bass too much midrange very distinct high end frequencies come through very clearly if play gigs having trouble cutting through other instruments d imagine pedal would do trick costs less than half many true competitors while affordability aspect distinct from quality cannot be ignored part initial disappointment was based side by side comparison mxr custom badass distortion latter did fuller sound was arguably better rhythm work an custom shop pedal from mxr try comparing pedal boss ds or mxr distortion blows them out water opinion m sure want roll crunch distortion being only dirt box board if used specific purpose mind like lead gain boost could afford joyo excellent ultimate drive overdrive pedal still less than most boutique or even boss distortion pedals go update about week into owning pedal did revise score from rating if graded pedal vacuum could absolutely see rating price tag ultimately there just few more problems quirks about pedal haven had other joyo products so score should reflect please note also which didn realize before internal trim pot presence easily accessible unless prepared remove circuit board three jacks connected distributor confirmed me necessary if want make adjustment no interest trying take apart fragile components small change might even do anything let get few things straight from start love effects pedals love idea handcrafted boutique pedal owned few ll also play mass produced boss ibanez stuff if put foreign no name brand front me pedal made well sounds good ll play too all need know pedal well constructed sounds darn good dollars joyo chinese company essentially has makes their own form factor heavy duty metal box an mxr like button switcher then clones mimics copies circuitry popular boutique pedals cost anywhere from they ve figured out how ship them u sell them each ve recently discovered these pedals if money pedalboard space were no issue there probably them d like own star joyo lineup however arguably jf ultimate drive pedal got some notoriety few years back when an american company bought them bulk repainted them tried sell them almost fact they thought they could get much tells something about quality pedal supposedly clone off fulltone ocd overdrive boutique pedal came out several years ago usually sells from around own pedal ve done side by side comparison pedal board while tone extremely subjective m sure wouldn go joyo ultimate drive blind test while knob lo hi switch clearly inspired by fulltone ocd pedals actually sound quite different exact same settings fulltone will actually sound much brighter really saying something because fulltone known having very well rounded tone defined base well ultimate drive offers even more bass mids yet tone knob can brighten up quite bit without losing bottom end actually extremely versatile m sure would do low gain crunch sounds very well if what want consider joyo vintage overdrive joyo crunch distortion or tubescreamer right now three pedals fairly similar offer great overdriven marshall tone fulltone ultimate drive marshall gv guv nor while they all great pedals joyo really hits sweet spot vox combo amp using gibson les paul soloing lead play m noticing all types pick attack harmonic response joyo don get other stompboxes really does act feel like an onboard overdrive channel if point all knobs at o clock some people may think muddy tone knob really does change character quite bit sorry long rant want people know just because can afford single pedal doesn mean can enjoy great overdrive stomp box check jf out just might be your gateway drug other joyo pedals revised previous star review after playing joyo british some more especially after using direct line recording now rate at stars phrase marshall box gets thrown around lot usually people using particular marshall amp mind example wampler plexi drive sounds like an older plexi while mi audio crunch box will do jcm compressed high gain tone recommendations several people picked up joyo british sound hoping could clone full spectrum those different amps does british sound succeed at goal yes no certain settings british sound does offer convincing tube like sound reminiscent marshall cabinet can clean up quite bit works very well foundation pedal placed last your effects chain give amp marshall character boosted by other overdrive distortion pedals note pedal actually its own preamp so recommended use plug directly into power amp section combo amp or into pa system or mixer directly can use effects chain into another preamp will diminish its effectiveness despite those good traits there just few things off about first seems add quite bit more noise hiss than some other joyo sound pedals or perhaps just more noticeable due fact supposed be marshall so turned up second several other reviewers noted voice control seems exactly backwards what should be turning clockwise makes sound thinner other three joyo sound pedals opposite true functionally really should mean nothing does make bit more confusing dial if read manual tech21 british upon which pedal supposedly cloned they claim voice character knob would be jtm bluesbreaker territory would be plexi anything above gives presence boost metalface haven tried all those amps perhaps meant brighten up turn up just design choice think possible get marshall tone want out thing work eq knobs each adjustment voice knob at price hard complain too much was very anxious get pedal mail try out so could write review own reviews all joyo products extremely polarizing some people love them think they re every bit good boutique pedals costing three times much while other people including significant portion hardcore techie community despise whole concept wish they didn exist having tried out specific product joyo jf california can tell m extremely impressed only having spent first word about joyo joyo chinese company which lot people loyal american products starts them off wrong foot further adding controversy fact many joyo pedals appear virtually copied circuitry well known western boutique pedals such fulltone ocd joyo ultimate drive ibanez tubescreamer joyo vintage overdrive mi audio crunchbox joyo crunch distortion if find disturbing or appalling won try change your mind consider following joyo has found way manufacture surprisingly faithful clones these very successful pedals at price even entry level casual players can afford larger companies such boss digitech ibanez openly copy ideas clone sounds or borrow inspiration from other successful pedals finally if want pay more boutique pedal nobody stopping from doing there certainly areas where joyo cuts costs by using cheaper materials joyo absolutely one one clone personal opinion if joyo has found way take concepts these pedals make them cheaper power them again reasonable minds can differ primary concern how does pedal sound answer question surprisingly good specific pedal cloned by joyo california from what m told tech nyc character series which was pedal series apparently now discontinued modeled popular amps such marshall fender vox mesa boogie like tech pedal there board knobs including one called voice which essentially transparency control more turn up less sounds like your original amp more sounds like mesa boogie there also band eq low mid high which seems do pretty good job crafting your tone finally there level gain knobs work if they were corresponding knobs your amp fortunately find level gain at o clock volume basically par your original signal trying describe tone writing difficult obviously going vary great deal depending your amp other cables effects run gibson les paul through small vox valvetronix combo resulting tone was good most importantly sounded very different than normal tones would get through amp admittedly do much experience using an actual mesa boogie amplifier think people get little too wrapped up making direct comparison anyway obviously if want true sound mesa boogie half stack re going go buy real equipment tone found pedal was very full bodied yet still retaining clarity high strings drive knob works better at lower mid level gains capable higher gains though did find pedal become somewhat noisy drive knob past o clock there two ways think pedal first could use an always amp modeler if really like tone produces case could turn voice up keep drive low while adding other distortion pedals effects base sound second could think strictly distortion overdrive pedal turn only parts songs where want effect however one very nice very amp like feature overdriven tone provided by pedal tone cleans up very nicely when turn volume down your final note build quality joyo california out box looks be fantastic switch click metal button similar those used mxr pedals there back cover 9v battery or there well placed dc 9v adapter jack which works standard 9v adapters such boss onespot sorry length review wanted provide some good information based experiences since struggled find honest reviews while was doing research can promise everyone will like considering poor quality pedals used buy from dod danelectro ibanez soundtank growing up pretty hard regret giving joyo california serious look at same price enjoy us dream supposed clone suhr riot only one new model joyo pedals own high gain distortion pedal covers gain range something like proco rat retains its clarity even at higher gain settings when first pulled out box plugged sounded great wondered if might be little bright was pleasantly surprised when rolled back tone knob around o clock rolled off harsh high end while retaining clarity fullness at least setup les paul into vox valvetronix watt one few distortion pedals capable full sounding power chords singing high leads unlike some distortion pedals fizzy ds or cocked wah sound boss power stack was really pleased tone all over neck while joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices one first three would recommend along outstanding ultimate drive warm sounding vintage overdrive however worth noting build quality bit suspect new model joyo pedals which notably lighter than those numbered jf lower weight comparable an mxr badass distortion except switch output jacks more suspect still if pedal sounds great has yet fail me refuse trash review until something actually fails me think if take care use reasonably should last awhile if doesn being out still better than being out wow been impressed lot joyo products their sweet baby overdrive was one came highly recommended hasn disappointed held off little bit until price came down truth thing worth every penny sold then some description says mild overdrive won give brown sound meant metal almost like adding tube amp gain knob your existing rig add subtle yet dynamic saturation sustain an otherwise clean tone chords notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or out unlike many tube overdrive pedals thing has tons volume tap can set drive still nice loud clean boost turn up drive can do blues rock think more an enhancement your clean tone opposed an effect transforms respect actually reminds me boss od overdrive which vastly underrated pedal though od probably offers more gain focus knob interesting doesn act exactly like tone knob turn up doesn remove bass changes gain structure little opens up tone lower settings bluesy higher settings bright dynamic chances both will sound good there some concerns could about build quality switch may be built last years having remove screws get 9v jack annoying also wish they d put 9v adapter jack top instead side those mostly minor gripes an excellent overdrive an incredible value thrilled been chinese made joyo overdrive distortion pedals ve tried out recent past felt like jf dyna compressor was somewhat risk had been using very excellent mxr custom comp already was frustrated its lack external controls versatility also one thing thing joyo clone circuitry distortion pedal could they do accurately an always effect like compression well joyo has absolutely done they ve done well enough m selling mxr compressors hard explain even harder demonstrate youtube video so let me offer explanation what pedal does why should give try only around primary effect compression level or normalize output across frequencies particularly clean signal aggressive playing can lead annoying volume swells also certain notes sustain while others seem die out too early compression smooths over these problems levels everything polished presentable sound secondary effect compression pedal can sustain single notes chords by increasing their level after they would normally die out area joyo jf superior many other compressors because gives attack sustain knobs attack refers how soon compression effect kicks after note struck turning knob up produces chicken picking effect where note very clear pronounced adjusting sustain knob obviously increases length time note or chord continues play at volume like most compressors there also level control change volume compressed sound compressors can actually find under such mxr dyna comp boss cs compression sustainer like one best mxr models good clarity tone only two knobs lack customization problem may want high sustain or attack playing u2 type parts might find excess sustain too messy punchy ac dc riffs joyo allows make change easily boss cs good pedal has controls attack sustain also tone pedal produces lot noise resulting tone sounds too digitized also tone knob compression pedal strikes me an admission pedal changing your tone which good compression really shouldn do joyo dyna compressor sounds like amp just puts some polish final product allows me add sustain punch if see fit great pedal amazing value exh hot tubes compact pedal offers very unique sound difficult review from an objective standpoint had no knowledge or experience original full sized hot tubes pedal from late frankly many reviews read online about both original reissue were less than flattering think part hatred comes from fact an analog pedal without actual tubes claims both name device artwork casing sound like an overdriven tube amplifier really though if think about doesn every overdrive pedal including venerable tubescreamer make same claim when plugged into hot tubes was surprised immediately intrigued actually ended up purchasing over excellent east river drive which was very good also very familiar sounding clone ts what hot tubes does anything familiar from an affordable od pedal pedal has significant amount output unlike many other overdrives has considerable low end fact likely even adds bass your sound there tone circuit bypass switch do fully understand basically switch off there no tone control they advertise sound powerful touch responsive since pedal darker side things however actually left position worked tone from settings gain structure bizarre unique though actually starts make sense if think about how gain responds an actual vintage tube amp from setting up around your tone basically remains clean provided started clean signal setup was strat into fender super champ x2 which tube hybrid amp great clean blackface setting however hot tubes completely transforms tone setting amp normally bright some great upper end chime hot tubes offered thick smokey tone was mostly clean maybe bit muffled grit mixed into start get past overdrive knob amount gain increases exponentially at point pedal behaves more like an overdrive though gain almost fuzz like some people described jack white type sound ll really leave individual users decide if they like or there aspects pedal could be objectively critical about first want make clear dark bassy pedal respect completely different from exh soul food east river drive both which some measure bass drop tone circuit only helps open up tone slight bit could do more do believe type overdrive would stack might actually benefit from brighter overdrive stacking into if your rig already dark or muffled side may want stay away from pedal being said would definitely recommend try before buy one because different hard describe ways now rating stars solid ehx construction very compact accessible 9v jack top where like unique overdrive sound at an affordable price doesn sound at all like other overdrives certainly won be everybody so far like what hear
339	 guitarists become bunch cork sniffers there so many players more concerned name headstock their their amp endless boutique pedals their collections many seem unable or unwilling give listen stock gear or anything doesn cost an arm leg fact if re gigging musician am come realize all those subtle detailed nuances tone so many want obsess over get lost band mix poor acoustics wherever re playing yes we want sound good ourselves because inspiring frankly don need dollar distortion od pedals be inspired haven owned ds long time recently got one because was looking distortion pedal budget frankly d forgotten how musical pedal distortion set minimum never gets clean good moderate gain overdrive still lets your basic tone get through play strat jazzmaster those guitars still sound like themselves thing gain at halfway get great ad dc crunch even gain maxed out still get excellent note definition chords what more could want sure old school rock distortion usual may appeal metalheads caveat applies maybe combine an eq could scoop mids much want also barber ltd great relatively cheap boutique moderate gain od doesn break bank visual sound route which tubescreamer clone much more gain compressor one pedal both ltd rt usual ts9 midrange hump though much less pronounced ltd what refreshing about ds strong mids there overall tone same realm tubescreamer so can sit well pedalboard bring different flavor party tone ds can get very bright indicated play single coils no problem finding sweet spots tone knob generally run around overall pedal steal look around find used one good price d considered modtone speedbox decided go generally bulletproof boss instead basically same price couldn be happier ve been using crybaby going years now some guitarists claim having them your signal chain affects your tone negative way well ve never noticed me these always feel perfect also can adjust which part sweep re using very easily ie if want more treble or bass just little comb moves wheel pot ve tried other wahs morley doesn do me vox very good just always gone what knew no complaints crybaby think many most guitarists always lookout new things picks easy cheap thing try favorite picks last years snarling dogs brain picks they re nylon picks raspy cat tongue surface makes super easy grip ve also had few these gator grip picks few years now like them quite bit they re favorite tend use something around or just under mm electric bit less than acoustic these picks matte finish which makes easy retain your grip them sound wise don find they re significantly different from any other pick if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become first love these picks used them exclusively years dozens them they never wear out used use them when playing loud rock band never had any issues they very comfortable easy control now bad sound sound plucked itself hard plastic pick against string makes very noticeable plinking sound audible through your amp if all re playing loud music may be an issue essentially stopped using them when started playing different band more dynamics because during quieter passages plinking sound pick strings very noticeable me so too bad think these great picks d like them be made softer material bought some these few years ago just try them out gel name sounded intriguing these ok colors bright otherwise they re just standard plastic picks which an electric prefer nylon because less clicky strings these fine if pull one out gig bag ll use overall there other styles pick d buy before buying these again nothing wrong them they re just normal plastic picks nothing special other than maybe brightness colors owned boss graphic eq many years ago never really took ah folly youth first pedal dirt cheap build quality actually seems very solid sliders nice feel them does off switch if any tonal issues your amp then graphic eq an easy solution no won make love an amp hate if re almost there or even just want add some sonic variety won really realize how useful vital graphic eq rig right now strat jazzmaster into pro jr love amp volume goes up treble gets bit piercing ve been able tame issue pedal subtle thing takes some time play around sliders figure out what will really hit your amp sweet spot at least application where m leaving all time pedal would also be good solo boost has plenty output make your leads punch through overall price can go wrong one those pedals has million applications will always use setup m thinking getting second one building pedalboard specific acoustic rig comp eq chorus reverb ve had one these about years gigged extensively ve only had replace once more later m really cork sniffer re tone think most our tone comes from our fingers so trend last several years toward high dollar cables lost me think monster cable sounds fine better well better than what don really notice difference when use different cables maybe slight difference high frequencies so slight be negligible look cables will last what really care about so far monster cable does trick use other brands too most expensive cable think was worth spent all those years ago oh return process was maybe years ago called monster they gave me their address had pay about ship back them about weeks later had new cable consider be excellent customer service ran across thing few weeks ago decided give try d been looking boom attachment non boom stand because play sing seemed perfect regular booms always been necessary evil book they can be helpful also take up too much air space cramped stages or small rehearsal spaces thing gives plenty room get stand out way without making an annoyance itself other thing like elbow where adjusts has teeth interlock so re just tightening joint relying friction those kind things eventually fail once tightening bolt gets tired anyway no reservations about one dead simple idea works great years ve used super cheap rake hangers can get at hardware stores metal u coated rubber heavy duty screw end these fine except some guitars don want fit recently when trying widen mouth one weld failed so u detached from screw part well got me thinking should find better solution hanging guitars thing hate overpaying things me way too much hanger sure important something solid hold our babies want feel like m getting some value bought these hangers they re rock solid others said put some good screws into stud don bother hassle drywall anchors provided just used some drywall screws like simplicity metal plate yoke attached u easy adjust width retainer rings slide very easily ve tried both acoustic electric guitars all hang away from wall no complaints these great quality seems excellent seems just about right me ve owned pedal about years good overall reverbs fall short ideal me they just sound bit inauthentic noticeable at times band setting probably wouldn be noticable think way they trail off tails tend little unnatural decay or something ve been using boss fender reverb pedal about years now main reverb neither amps reverb what ve done last year use digitech wetter setting usually church or hall if want reverb solo application works fine sounds great leave all time reverb find bit lacking if want bunch decent sounds could do much worse plus thing obviously rugged ve abused really just regular gigging abuse all time never failed work been overall experience digitech stuff long time play bought one each various thicknesses these picks few years ago they re very interesting these soft rubber little bit give so they really soften your attack cut higher frequencies similar using your thumb exactly still pull one these out every once awhile certain applications getting particular sound song say these could be exactly what re looking overall these well made ones bought will probably last me forever these would never work me main pick m glad tried them though nothing else remotely like them ve tried all types these they re pretty much advertised don really find huge difference tone between relative hardnesses rubber there small degree me these too dull sounding an acoustic well they don sound bad if then switch normal pick ll notice upper upper mid harmonics being de emphasized by duller attack doesn sound bad certain applications would be fine wouldn want be everyday acoustic tone though they fare much better electric where difference attack can be less notable ll still notice loss some sparkle most part found sound very agreeable useable pick tends catch strings bit there more friction course just something get used bottom line like these they ll probably last me almost forever don really see them becoming go picks like thickness feel they won slip out your hand while playing loss high end just enough don think want limit myself way except certain situations tend switch back forth between pick fingers anyway so already get sound similar by using fingers worth try though just might find keeper if need tame an amp or just bit too bright know at higher volumes too easy high frequencies be emphasized these might work better live setting where ve got your amp cranked up ve been using roughly year now works fine feels bit cheap then cheap easy move spring loaded capo also much lower profile overall like certainly worth minimal price ve been using one spot power gator small pedalboard about years now time ve done probably over gigs ve never had problem super quiet no when pedals amps gain single coil pickups there will be noise fact life ve never found be excessive turn volume your all way down when re playing would recommend anyone looking an affordable solution powering their pedalboard got one students whose mom just wanted cheap case her acoustic now let be clear easily worth very bare bones gig bag will protect your instrument degree only has minimal padding probably good enough any beginner instrument one students has one those esteban infomercial guitars which pretty low quality terrible unplayable gig bag instrument has no padding whatsoever only give stars because little more money possible get something which feel noticably better musician friend acoustic gig bag paid few years ago well made probably has twice padding thing so isn bad worth price put together just fine only just barely serves its purpose protecting your instrument d never trust an instrument any value gig bags can be good alternative hard case if space or weight concern isnt bad choice just be aware what re getting friend gave me few these overall like them d give them stars if could having said don like them much regular nylon pick star hole just feels bit weird me though could probably get used m glad got try these these won replace favorite nylon picks first fatso flex cable think ve had spectraflex cables before they ve been fine ve owned lost lent etc so many over years can recall look feel cable excellent seems very solid always difficult tell cables like flexibility much better than monster cable which much stiffer tends want coil back onto itself fatso nice flexible looks fantastic sounds fine no issues m one those who believes all snakeoil about high end cables being necessary get something decent isn noisy tone comes from your equipment no issues regard fatso one last thing ve gotta love amazon got red violet each while other colors same lengths were twice price or more so wasn choosey about colors got they look great though oh one thing m bit iffy about spectraflex lifetime warranty fine print requires sales receipt bs imo says something affect we will decide if we will replace so way what will about monster they ll replace anything no receipt which more reasonable think ll worry about when time worry about worth considering return process might be exactly hassle free pretty nifty item does just what says very easily get one these ll soon picks coming out your ears only issue pick punched from say an old credit card isn going replace favorite picks great idea executed very well no issues product itself find incredibly useful me if re particularly picky no pun intended then one these will supply picks lifetime

holy moley amp has limited gain available give traditional tube behavior nice break up very reactive your playing literally miles clean head room unlike those tube amps pedals can come into play can manipulate clean sound at any level without losing bit clarity or depth also has an ipod jack headphone jack ambiance e make sound kind boxy does model like crush or roland cube has own voice ve heard compars fender tweed tone guess can see still has own voice which important me any amp should note an ac30 or fender twin or high end 1x12 tube still louder much fuller we re talking tube amps don matching extension cabinet because just don need really loud mustang iii gets destroyed by zt at volume dial can hit ds actually make out notes something vox ac4 or fender blues junior cannot do

345	 from greg abrams review entitled all tone snobs review further down product page alright so want get good if somewhat basic distortion sound less than your deal strongly disagree can find much better distortions or less even few near or under mark ds currently priced at ve played over years like many people one first pedal purchases was ds afterall everyone talks about them they re available at any given music store nation hear about all these famous musicians using them plus ds actually pretty cheap so snapped one up just like everyone else come find out just because something popular doesn always mean its good see nickelback transformers movie franchise kardashian family etc so plugged didn really care distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding always noisy tried both amps practic amp solid state fender frontman 25r big amp b at100 which 100w tube halfstack was was very diverse basic sound was very likeable me ve read japanese made ds better sound than newer made taiwan models either way ds just great pedal mind like many newer players didn know any better at time fast forward few years ve bought sold literally dozens pedals there whole world great tones be found out there if keep your eyes open so here some pedals currently own like much better than ds all them great general purpose distortions easy enough find new used most shops can at time writing be bought brand new or less here good ol amazon com rugged enough last years boss ds turbo distortion lest catch any flames from people thinking m boss hater m certainly loved tu odb md xt among others ll start ds big brother pedal has much nicer tone mention distinct distortion modes setting pretty much higher quality ds ii setting brighter richer tone ds completely overshadows ds popularity can find ds all over ebay very cheap prices very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many pro co rat2 great dirty distortion pedal probably personal favorite ve heard box used literally hundreds if thousands songs last years its used by just ridiculous amount guitarists its rich full distortion at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy ve never heard bad tone out mine its great getting big amp kind sound out small practice amp its also great pushing big amp too much headroom into overdriven sweet spot without having crank amp volume truly excellent pedal ehx little big muff big muff another pedal ve heard hundreds songs its kind fuzz kind distortion definitely owns its own sonic territory very big saturated warm used heavily classic rock tones also beyond tons grunge garage used by everyone from carlos santana david gilmour smashing pumpkins dinosaur jr jack white personally reccomend little big muff only touch creamier tone than recent nyc reissue its smaller uses regular 9v adapter its cheaper great pedal mxr distortion distortion great first distortion can usually be found pretty cheap whats nice about distortion sounds great anything lack tone knob helps keep somewhat transparent e can more easily hear natural tone your amp doesn cover over your equipments sound used by quite few famous folks including greatful deads jerry garcia randy rhoads ozzy famous guitarist steve jones sex pistols danelectro cm cool cat metal make sure get cool cat metal metal ii fine pedal well its definitely more traditional metal pedal cool cat metal or cm actually very very different pedal from most metal pedals basically its pre amp sits floor has fully adjustable eq tons volume gain through roof so can do anything from clean boost gain at minimum there virtually no coloration your tone high gain metal stuff plenty great overdrive rock tones between works well any amp ve tried can find tons great sounds its an unbelievably versatile pedal its even true bypass best part danelectro seems made way too many them so can easily find one used or even new under true hidden gem actually cheaper than ds joyo jf crunch distortion little guy surprised me its supposedly clone mi audio crunch box if so must be one awesome pedal too its essentially marshall stack box boy does ever succeed at great crunch tons volume gain really can make your practice amp sound like big ragin stack even sounded good going into modeling amp very few pedals work well modeling amp one even sounded better than marshall simualtion built can get brand new one shipped fantastic speaking joyo ve had few their pedals well one or two from moen another chinese pedal maker m honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag especially themoen mo fm fuzz moowhich honestly out big muffs every big muff ve ever played through so joyo moen they both make variety great sounding fuzz od dirt pedals check them out before anyone gets all up arms about supporting chinese company please keep mind none pedals listed review ds included made america let alone western hemisphere hopefully these suggestions give something look also if can actually try pedal out at store youtube great place hear demos what different pedals can do should also mention if try love ds suits your needs than more power tone subjective every pedal sounds different running through different guitars amps just because may share different opinions something love okay main reason posting lengthy review give newer players some information plenty options distortion pedals ds only thing out there affordable find something truly love buy if its ds one pedals ve mentioned here or anything else important part sounds right people complain these aren really rolling string trees despite fact description never says or even implies they fact rolling string trees honestly they don need be at least most guitars these small round guides superior flat wider styles most string trees because they way less actual contact strings less contact means less friction less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don much chance get caught up anything when they move put them cheap telecaster copy noticed results immediately did replace either tuners or nut those still cheap stock parts if whammy bar bend lot rollers might be little better five bucks an easy upgrade anyone can change them all need screwdriver was no brainer telecaster ve owned over dozen dirt boxes over years just love rat makes tube halfstack sing practice amp sound like big amp its great stand alone distortion running clean amp can get everything from perfect bluesy grit roaring sludge just max out distortion use your neck pickup an lp sound exactly like king buzzo melvins everything inbetween can also be used boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory case point buddy has an old peavy stack from his garage its solid state head top vertical cab two speakers its own can use gain distortion knobs present amp get decent sound his les paul still sounded oddly dark we put rat front some fiddling got perfect ac dc style overdrive out think main reason love rat so much only great tone its sheer indestructability filter knob normal tone knobs allow focus more bass or treble usually if boost one cut other filter more high end roll off can darken or brighten your tone accordingly when do go brighter still same bottom end doesn cut bass out so even more treble heavy sound still fuller rounder tone doesn thin out so much its really an excellent pedal ve heard some claim get an older one lm308 chip really get sound myth look few forums or youtube plenty tests testimony showing fact new ones do indeed sound same old ones rat rat whether they re coming from china or usa p mine from face still glows dark so dunno what other guy was complaining about if re familiar ehx signature distortion fuzz pedal big muff please go shop somewhere try one out describing its sound words helps doesn really do justice definitely owns its own sonic territory after playing through one while ll see why so many guitarists so many fields one hand they re one very favorite effects honestly so review m going focus more how little big muff stacks up against other models starters version takes care all common complaints regarding nyc reissue its true bypass its much smaller super tiny like boss little slimmer than say wider mxr pedals like phase uses normal 9v adapter jack thank finally sounds better yes indeed sounds better than ny reissue some complained about buzzy sound recent reissue has one smoother creamy russians also doesn suck tone like one does either its touch higher gain than both russians tone wicker versions all all absolutely big muff so if re market one these don want options tone wicker muff provides absolutely where its at its better every way than ny reissue also costs less money yay ll be upfront honest right away say m biggest fan headstock tuners love idea usually feel execution leaves bit be desired when popped up vine newsletter thought d give go see if one fixed any things don like about other ones cough snark cough little background first guess ve been playing last years currently two other tuners little korg plug type where can pick up your signal an instrument cable or just use microphone front tune up also boss tu pedal tuner if m jamming friends or playing show tu what ll use stay tune its very durable accurate like how can step engage both tuner cut out signal so can tune silence annoy friends or audience home practice use korg usually tune up before start playing then just plug into practice amp blast away korg nice accurate easy enough use alternate tunings years having around including out jam sessions before buying tu ve only had buy one replacement first saw headstock tuner year ago when friend went get an electronic tuner guy at store talked him into blue snark everyone seems these days he was incredibly pleased only was somewhat garish big blue ball sitting your headstock seemed kinda flimsy me wasn exatly easy tune up while thought idea having tuner worked off resonation your would be cool seemed like design had bit ways go before was something d want headstock enter mini headstock tuner by planet waves does fix problems made snark so unappealing friend me accuracy does seem tune accurately good thing already puts ahead snark its easy use alternate tunings however so do keep mind also letters take some getting used they use kind chunky lcd block style find some dvd players huge complaint isn idiot proof korg or tu looks ease use quite bit more subtle than snark able hide behind your headstock which quite preferable having blue ball sitting end your only problem hiding behind back your headstock if les paul style headstock where three tuners each side may trouble finding spot where tuner actually fits can be seen lp copy has larger grover tuners so only choice very end headstock wear fairly low so was able find an area where can see from top down those who sling bit higher might be outta luck those fender style headstocks should no problem though ll work great them also plenty bright so seeing well enough going be an issue durability where main drawback these types tuners snark very easy break rests small ball joint planet waves mini isn going lose its head too easy ratcheting clip made plastic don expect hold up under too much use tuner itself made fairly light duty plastic too so nice would be keep your pocket way jam session still think would be easy enough break haven had long enough happen yet so can only give initial impressions let just say d never gig guy only tuner its obviously going be rugged enough type use all all better headstock choice than snark however headstock tuners whole still ways go before they re gonna work everyone anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind pedal tuner personally suggest boss tu or tu or korg pitchblack know they re more expensive ll be happier off long run those looking convenient way tune up between songs during jam session nice option may hold up forever ll probably stick tu korg plug headstock tuners go nicer than most these some bright strings play pick mostly stay realm rock n roll so no comments slapping popping claims packaging makes there plenty great rock tones be found heck crank amp dig pick these would be great strings any motorhead covers re planning playing good bright steel tone anywhere near harsh your fingertips or frets rotosounds they re only jackson bad string excellent tone m bit surprised by mean d addario strings fine all they ve always just been your average basic string me these promise be premium contender they certainly deliver strung up agile al best les paul copy can buy look them up them tuned up these things rich full harmonic tone plenty bend sustain these strings really do feel sound great never thought d be praising d addario so much these strings really do deliver
346	 little more expensive than some other brands think sounds great way more durable than plastic pedal m pretty new electric so m really distortion tone expert like some other reviewers me sounds better easier adjust than modeling amp so think good purchase m an acoustic player every once while break out strat just some fun get little variety wanted get some cool 70s fuzz going just play around experiment me pedal was great way do electric m tone freak don need everything sound authentic me pedal gets way there has two different types fuzz plenty flexible controls if re comparing boss fuzz pedal one probaly lower build quality e g made from plastic also only m taking gigging or stomping garage so ll gladly take savings at first seemed stupid buy wire cutters just strings these do work extremely well they seem be very high quality easily clip strings right tuner post do agree other user who pointed out fact they re spring loaded open no mechanism keep them closed does make storing them little akward again think best product out there if change your own strings ps if using scissors clip strings ends crazy buy these things
347	 pedal has been around long time though overall quality has declined boss has cut corners enable lower priced mass production their pedals boss ds remains staple image distortion stompbox ds no frills tank pedal was designed withstand direct nuclear blast well michael moore stepping so know can take any amount punishment might care give pedal doesn replicate any type amplifier marshall box or mesa boogie or vox or fender from tonal aspect isn complex or dynamic will add plenty grind your tone plenty hum go if re looking your first distortion pedal use your watt practice amp look no further if decent tube amp look elsewhere because pedal get what pay simply will do quality amp justice pros inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal cons lots hum tone control gets really shrill really fast without excessive hum almost unusable tone control would get stars m going do any explaining about science behind how pedal works m just going focus review how pedal affects your tone definitely isn boost also an eq bbe sonic stomp uniquely functioning pedal ear serves add clarity depth body your tone essentially pedal allows get most out tones your amp already producing lo contour knob doesn increase amount bass produced by amp rather tightens up generally increases depth bass low mid tone ear may sound at first like bass has been increased hasn re just hearing all bass tone was there first place was jumbled up signal went from your amp process knob really just focuses treble high mid frequencies these frequencies can often be very unpleasant grating hear sonic stomp sort evens smooths out those tones so they clearer less harsh say can dial some very aggressive cutting highs if play lead metal or something indeed ll make those searing lead tones even better now gave product stars because ve had any issues or haven been any way unsatisfied rather because really fairly subtle effect at first almost couldn tell difference between having off time ve been able better recognize appreciate impact has tone doesn make night day difference recommend pedal someone who already has tone re happy just want make even better pedal won make cheap watt solid state combo sound like tube half stack won make love your tone when were completely unsatisfied before conclusion though definitely wouldn put pedal into must category definitely improves quality tone pedal leave all time improves both clean distorted tones since right now only review product amazon com ll try answer any questions might about ehx pocket metal muff pedal pedal model simplicity volume control distortion control switch changes amount or lack thereof mid scoop doesn leave much room tone tweaking so tweakers beware being said electro harmonix did commendable job pre setting useable treble bass tone levels should only require minor tweaking your amp eq get right where want playing through fender hotrod deville amp was immediately shocked at how good pedal sounded bass was powerful chunky great heavy metal palm muting riffs treble had good bite wasn harsh all three midrange modes sounded great depending application want just flat midrange punchy tone just leave mid switch flat setting want slightly scooped midrange tone good all round metal tone move switch down low mid scoop mode do want play master puppets by metallica high mid scoop mode calling your name pedal offers quite bit distortion was amazed find even at higher distortion levels tone remained clear defined didn turn into plastic y fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals cough metal zone cough will will mention pedal isn best if re looking more modern metal tone won get slightly fizzy ultra gain think slipknot sound out pedal rather offers very crunchy defined roar more characteristic pre dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers conclusion give pedal stars because does what its designed do very well version metal muff line isn designed be highly versatile tweakable itself get metal muff top boost pedal if want band eq boost function pedal designed be very simple small box pure classic metal tone exactly what accomplishes pretty awesome pedal especially if re going more an or metal sound more chunky defined than fizzy think earlier mesa models like famous mark iii c was used by metallica master puppets album course no pedal can perfectly replicate sound metal muff does pretty amazing impression some best aspects metal muff include great clarity definition even higher gain settings seriously most high gain pedals cause lose lot definition your playing metal muff doesn do so especially lead guitarist should be major selling point wide range tone controls some pedals really hard hear difference when adjust tone controls so metal muff can easily dial sound re after or maybe even find new sound like even better quality construction absolutely superb everything about pedal rugged durable d feel totally comfortable gigging without backup different note ve only used pedal fender hotrod tube amp sounds great however prefer rocktron zombie pedal metal muff see review zombie more info however rocktron zombie doesn sound good through solid state amps mention because if re using tube amp honestly feel zombie better option if re playing through solid state amp ve read metal muff still shines just something consider conclude pedal awesome if re looking pedal give an all round good straight up metal sound sure bit one trick pony pretty good trick if re looking an ultra high gain distortion monster then look else where otherwise recommend giving metal muff look start full name pedal would indicate pedal tube amps can comment how ll sound hybrid experience definitely solid state distortion pedals go much better solid state further tube screamers aren meant take your tube amp from clean high gain again what distortion pedal will do tube screamers general designed drive your tubes little harder most commonly used solo boost tube screamers category overdrive pedals like name would indicate they re meant add little extra over an already driven amp more natural smooth organic way then distortion pedal would however ibanez ts 9dx does more than your typical tube screamer extra knob switches between ts9 hot turbo mode adds whole lot tone use options let me expound play hard rock metal through bugera head basically marshall jcm cab celestion vintage speakers while amp does fair amount gain bass tap quite enough accurately get more modern tones unaided standard ibanez ts or some other knock off tube screamer will be able get an amp like mine into more modern heavier tones because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass add some mids again help solos cut through mix extra knob ibanez ts9dx solves problem by switching hot or turbo mode pedal adds bass little extra gain incrementally like setting best so way use pedal ll set amp standard crunchy rhythm tone gain amp already fairly high then songs utilize little heavier sound ll kick ts9dx drive pretty low o clock volume at o clock tone about o clock mode these settings increases bass general thickness tone adds little gain volume so basically like adding another channel amp will add one detail might make or break pedal tubescreamers general certainly ibanez ts 9dx add mid range your tone automatically can dial out regular ts mode adds some low mids little more high mids other modes add more low mids particular which part contribute overall thickness tone which can be great if re after scooped mid sound say metal then would only recommend pedal solo boost where mids will help cut through mix conclusion probably safe say most people who buy tubescreamers probably playing blues some sort just looking boost their volume maybe add little dirt yes pedal will do so will bbe greenscreamer behringer tube overdrive mxr distortion plus boss sd digitech bad monkey or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations by adding turbo mode options ibanez ts 9dx will work hard rock metal players depending exact style way these plethora other options won if re anything like me then know what re thinking digitech digital fake sounding junk anymore digitech hardwire cm finishes what digitech began bad monkey which great overdrive pedal its own right cm offers tone quality compares best market pedal maniac ve owned wayyyy too many overdrive distortion pedals so all humility know what m talking about flexibility rivaled by none market anything close price what makes cm so great like several other reviews mentioned just another tube screamer clone there no distinct mid range hump slightly rolled off bass tubescreamers particularly ts known there lot range all knobs level can add some serious boost bass treble knobs allow significantly change your tone if what re after or can dial be more never completely transparent also cm has more gain tap than most overdrive pedals can go from basically clean boost adding surprising amount saturation your tone lastly classic vs modified switch gives option adding some gain bass by switching from classic modified ve tested cm both an overdrive clean channel fender hotrod deville front end boost bugera basically marshall jcm cm sounds great both applications over clean channel fender sounds very full smooth even turned all way up overdrive never sounded very grainy or fuzzy maintained warmed organic tube like boutique esque how would characterize great blues playing m sure playing tone knobs could dial some good country tones well however use more front end boost already overdriven bugera amp

349	 very generic sounding distortion really useful much beyond lead boost into an already distorted amp same true many pedals from era including gasp tube screamer tube screamer great lead boost into an already distorted amp too many people will tell great stand alone distortion because same goes boss ds now here where things get interesting there plenty modifications can be done pedal by keely monte allums others turn otherwise mediocre pedal into raging beast dripping tone gain sings weeks cost pedal or so costs get materials mod well worth mine modified monte allums tri gain rectifier modification absolutely killer use lead boost by itself nice overdriven tone ll find plenty use if want basic solid well built distortion pedal by itself boss ds really nothing special platform great sounding mods can go wrong yes cheap plastic yes battery life very short unit sucks life out battery couple hours yes battery difficult replace however best sounding cheap reverb pedal planet solved battery problem by using spot outlet pedal power supply doesn sound nearly cheap its construction or price might suggest everything from simulated spring reverb endless caverns here all sounds great even has modulated reverb which reverb slight flange chorus affecting reverb signal only dry signal which their version holy grail flerb setting about cost holy grail foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use unless course an elephant all complaining hear about other pedals cheap plastic cases yet hear about anyone actually breaking one while using behringer pedals hit miss one certainly hit play our band at church such ve been wanting vox ac15 quite some time those who do play contemporary christian music wondering what heck m talking about let just say an unwritten requirement if do play kind music must utilize vox tone because u2 know sounding weirder by second just take word anyway past few years ve been utilizing line floor pod plus achieve tone ve been using class sound which close quite useable some reason sounds mushy low strings strat ve never found way around just sort dealt then came father day year when wife surprised me used vox ac15c1 love everything about doing little research seems its predecessor ac15cc1 was decent there were certain things about sucked until mods were performed by owners well ac15c1 implements those popular mods what end up an amp awesome right out box ve seen some people complain about fact pcb inside hand wired made china so what sounds very nice especially low price amp overdrive very rich lots harmonic overtones higher crank master volume cranked living room was quire loud 15w amp window shattering loud church setting obviously an option fortunately can lower master volume amplifier still retains much glassy vox tone just at more manageable level need purchase an optional foot switch toggle between top boost normal channels ve opted just use normal channel push joyo ultimate drive pedal which by way most impressive overdrive pedal ll ever hear overdrive does interfere vox tone at all used morning stratocaster loaded dimarzio hs series pickups joyo pedal pushing amp was classic vox chime all way also used boss dd delay also required if play christian band same reason other thing mentioned pure tone heaven some noted noise or hiss problems amp which were usually solved by installing better set preamp tubes mine did problem actually thought did was certainly getting loud hiss out while before realized was way had amp set up stated earlier channel amp normal top boost which one re using determined by which input plug your into was plugged into normal channel didn realize top boost volume was dimed where hiss was coming from just shut volume completely off since was using top boost channel anyway problem solved m amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice ve owned marshalls mesa boogies laney music man other oddball tube amps over years some costing several times cost vox ac15c1 vox can hold its own those others think an affordable boutique amp if can pick one up used like did all better interestingly enough amp was advertized used vox ac15 no indication whether was c1 or cc1 fortunately was c1 value at full price also get one until today do own fulltone pedal product was designed replicate can search youtube see several comparisons there no audible difference aside from pedal quite awesome its own merit metal type distortion nicely covers everything else play an ibanez artcore through vox ac15 christian band set just small amount drive at about position pedal does add color your signal sound your amp shines through nicely whole point reason we choose certain amp because we like way sounds so when we push an overdrive pedal we don want change sound amp we simply want kick rump little or lot ultimate drive does nicely drive could best be described somewhat gritty smooth at same time like sand smoothie driven hard gives plenty nice harmonic overtones think sounds best just small amount kick right into tube amp m exactly bringing home tons money so nice see there pedals designed give great tone even tightwads like myself only thing could consider be downside stupid graphic satan darth maul gene simmons or whatever thing painted metal case other than if re market boutique style overdrive at about cost ve found one final note one unexpected benefit pedal overdrive does wonders single coil strat really gives nice fat crunch while somehow retaining strat tone can think any other pedals ve owned could do second final note m almost embarrassed admit also played through cheap solid state fender frontman 25r sounded great even through piece rubbish christian musician can say may exactly qualify miracle pretty close

353	 ve had about years now even some newer metal pedals market pedal still sells well mention probably also one most modded pieces out there any number mods can be found online change sound they re usually side improving stock tone which m happy ve always liked parametric eq pedal variable midrange allows me get marshall or mesa flavors most metal hard rock music gain range enough me if need yet more gain punch up an overdrive or compressor pedal cleaner boost even without boost can use death metal think if play tighter more technical styles better too much gain anyhow particular favor dual design why if need arises possible use regular strap doesn button locks installed two black ones string ibanez rg7321 laguna le200qbc guitars spare straps both guitars sometimes lock those spares plastic dunlop discs some older bass guitars similar dunlop locks standard version two which had locks installed mid one from gold dd all three them held up no issues didn need re tighten screws those guitars until about two years ago then again don tour around world like metal stalwarts known metallica seriously great pedal can improve upon what others said will mention few points use after preamp or dirt boxes lead tone or add more crunch fender frontman when inserted effects loop run before time based effects delay phaser etc me sometimes use before distortion clean booster while focusing one sliders boost few frequencies if gets noisy or self oscillates after while change battery fresh one better yet use an ac adapter found out about last issue after reading few harmony central reviews otherwise been setup about seven years take care stuff whatever name pedal from ibanez tube screamer camp packaging description says uses jrc4558 chip ma150 diodes yes behringer got sound right d say competes well against any modded ts pedals what love about pedal tone knob ts pedals price range most useful can set high isn too icepicky yet entire range useful great if use thing your main overdrive sound prefer pedal boosting gain hot amp or pedal or another overdrive works well lead boost rock or blues tones could also be used add touch breakup jazz tones bought pedal semi retire an older ibanez ts5 soundtank switch one isn good behringer behringer has much smoother action when turning pedal or off use mainly solid state fender amps several distortion pedals including boss metal zone d bet would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt only downside slight lack bass if routinely run your sound through inch speaker setups esp 2x12 4x12 or distorted tone plenty bass shouldn be problem what an amazing product multi voltage capability worldwide use powering eight pedals very cost effective too if bought eight adapters would cost me well over usd even at price sold at build quality pro level d be happy using well traveled pedalboard at price could buy two or three these packs power huge boards usually run six seven pedals typical session all at once nice know delivery smooth without any drops or spikes power level can crank em all if want go nuts ve never really owned fuzz pedal before tried few out most ve tried ve come across big muff most didn really strike me good flavor distortion until recently even boss hyper metal hm considered by some be fuzz pedal by some folks isn there certainly budget being what right now didn want spend lot fuzz pedal there loads fuzzes available or less model essentially three pedals one what attracted me along few reviews youtube mention bargain basement price three modes can be accessed via switch right side pedal two fuzz modes view don perfectly emulate any one pedal extremely useful nonetheless fuzz creamy midrange filled sound doesn get too bright until treble knob pushed past o clock fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich thick humbuckers actually quite clean silences until gain past about o clock love way fuzz sputters when notes chords decay seems work best power chords root 5th note single notes if play complex chords ll hardly notice them if try play them use little gain possible fuzz more line big muff has scooped midrange which makes things sound dark sinister increased bass treble complex chords work slightly better here fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz so buzzes longer makes great use alongside guitarist using looser sounding high gain tone isn necessarily fuzzy head era korn comes mind me third option ultimately what made purchase worthwhile boost mode clean boost flat midrange level actually distorts little only after cranking eq gain knobs all way up resulting buzz does sound bit like slightly overdriven non master volume amp or master volume clean channel fully cranked still throughout most its gain volume range boost does good job staying clean would be great pushing an amp into overdrive or extending gain heavily distorted sound might also be useful tiny volume boost cleaner tones or just maintain stronger signal path full effects overall like tones pedal spits out ve only had few hours love what m hearing so far build similar other behringer pedals nr100 noise reducer to800 their overdrive sounds like tube screamer more recent pedal built june knobs seem slightly sturdier than before d still abuse them too much though always really abusive stompers might want look elsewhere or find way put guts inside custom built tank can go wrong bright blue led either makes easy see dark stage along dayglo orange pedal color
354	 be honest was looking pedal would give me distortion similar megadeth first album kimb so far havnt got perfect setup yet ive got close enough pedal great only couple notes should make about do buy pedal if your expecting play classic rock or just rock general pedal metal battery drains like mf dont understand why only possible explanation can think leave plugged into amp ive had other pedals wouldnt drain battery unless its turned prefer just get an ac adapter use batteries other than those few things iv had no problems great pedal so bought these because being dunlop trust brand dont even mind they sorta big bulky only problem they scare piss out me its tighten washer nut situation what ive normally seen strap locks these pegs insert its so hard me trust these always hand gripped firmly even if just adjusting amp clench so scared little metal balls things will just slip peg fall out ruin havnet had single problem system yet never hope do if happens there will be an update good product so far just wouldn recommend there too much crap world be worried about strap locks shouldnt be one those things price got little more than expected sound pretty great scoop switch gives slightly different sound other than your can change amount distortion its cheap maybe doesn alot fancy versatility settings whatnot price one hell deal quality item only complaints its so little sometimes just accidentally moving cable will flip around or something thats expected big deal if re careful now one issue really pedal its cosmetic so its worth starring review did get me knobs they cool chrome ones these pictures they black plastic ones they look sorta bland cool ive noticed no functionality problems them yet still great product though bought practice amp was looking something little more portable what came has great distortion effect pretty awesome too lead cuts clean mostly general does tend get little noisy though however price probably one best steals ever like said sort name brand amp estimated at around can safely say sound quality item about good amp until can afford really good amp will be primary one really no problem pros cheap price fair sound quality nifty built effect can plug into aux letting play musiccons cheap item quality distortion can get messy very versatile metal only hope never breaks

357	 pedal was mainstay effects few years really does ton range although only does one effect at time so d reach down change knobs mid show order get other variations most commonly used setting was overdrive distortion mix knob at about o clock which produces very professional sounding grunge type effect if want any those sounds excluding heavier metal sounds pedal will definitely get there problem pedal step all way down turn which produces sound morley pedals separate off switch so can turn them or off at given position difference sound just bit more professional if wah isn always turning or off at top wah frequency suppose wanted set wah middle just leave there can really do pedal bit smaller than morley wah experience sound equivalent base models consider distortion sound cream doors zz top buzzy psychedelic type sound what pedal does unfortunately about all does however if want perfect break through intro sound absolutely pedal quality wise awesome if needed sound would definitely own one again got rid mine purchase some other gear served wider variety functions honestly haven missed because m doors cover band or anything
358	 buy cheap better than fuzz pedals cost times much can go from clean boost slight octave up fuzz has be heard amazing sounds mxr make pretty good pedals money thought would be high output saturated type distortion has plent volume which good boosting even gain knob turned all way up thing an overdrive which bad thing if what looking very mid rangey sound well just me well built would make decent od overall pretty vanilla flavored dirt pedal very boring dull uninspiring pedal don waste your time boss sd or digitech bad monkey far better options price range

also like fact utilizes dabber prevent spills accidents used other night feed rosewood telecaster difference was night day sure few bucks more than standard crybaby totally worth built like tank make sure apply little bit white lithium grease gear pieces once year or so keep things smooth reduce wear inner workings decided get tweed strap 50s telecaster classic when arrived was bit let down tweed finish cool enough strap very thin strap ends pretty poor quality if they truly made leather feel sorry hide they came from leather so hard almost need fingers steel get eyelets spread far enough apart get them around strap locks decent time being am definitely going keep eye out something more suitable feels like wearing casio suit was previously using rocksmith usb cable wanted specific cable imac unit definitely fits bill from what can hear when playing has an even lower latency than rs cable was getting little unwanted slapback rs cable unit seems taken care also quite nice headphone jack right up front quiet practice times software comes interface joke about useful an aol disc since use logic pro x mainstage wasn loss me if buying interface fact comes amp tones might want look somewhere else couldn even get software load imac me there too much depth can go into when describing picks either they feel good your hand or they don either they kind disappear when re playing or they feel like hindrance these dunlops get just right enough grip where re fumbling all over place they somehow get out way your playing they re right up there fender classic picks all time favorites use dunlop always makes top notch products so when came time find slide knew where look one produces great tone well made like other reviewers mention here might want invest slide case prevent thing from getting smashed bits general home use though wouldn worry about too much though bought bag mostly practice sessions here there or across town decent build quality wouldn feel comfortable assigning gig duty got fair amount padding nice storage array once again personally feel bag more suited mile trip practice or lessons after returning pedaltrain jr too small received pedaltrain soft case fits bill perfectly am using voodoo lab pedal power plus unit had some minor issues getting plug ins line up cutouts board itself other user here mentions cutouts board slightly too close together can center voodoo such way make sure both plugs useable overall install line did run into any connector issues mentioned by other user review here using voodoo lab pedal power plus system all connectors came voodoo lab pedal power plus fit perfectly there no clearance issues one quick pro tip leave connector brackets slightly loose when installing your voodoo lab pedal power plus will let make fine adjustments once voodoo lab pedal power plus dropped into back pedaltrain once lined up your liking or close possible based narrow cutouts then can tighten your brackets screws all way down then use punch mark your indented drill holes there pretty decent video youtube by pedaltrain which will help process only small complaint they don use center punch should always use something create starter divot especially when working soft metals overall great pedalboard am running boss tr boss od mxr dyna comp mxr phase dunlop crybaby eh cathedral reverb eh stereo memory man w harzai there plenty breathing room nothing cramped there plenty space patch power cable routing board received came supplied plenty soft sided velcro there another review here where user states they didn receive enough velcro cut strips each cross bars still had about soft sided velcro left over these little patch cables been indispensable since used them set up pedalboard they re durable tough yet provide high level flexibility when comes using them tight spaces inbetween effects pedals previously had been using some fender tweed patch cables they just weren flexible enough even though they looked cool days so if re looking great patch cable your pedalboard look no further friend ended up ordering cable connect 535q wah into dyna comp pedaltrain board perfect length foot cable was just little bit too short since then ve ordered these patch cable other lengths they ve done great job cleaning up look pedalboard ended up ordering cable connect bottom row effects top row pedaltrain board perfect length very slight bit excess can be zip tied against pedaltrain leaving total stealth install since then ve ordered these patch cable other lengths they ve done great job cleaning up look pedalboard even though tuner pedalboard setup one imac via mainstage snark indispensable perfect those times when don want drag out bunch gear just want noodle around even without an amp use little guy electric guitars could see being perfect acoustic guitars barely takes up any room at all case or gig bag concept stand great thought would be perfect two telecasters until get stands place put guitars them stands very deep angle from what could tell guitars were sitting about degrees back just looks silly like your guitars trying slip out stand or slow motion fall backwards also ends up taking up way too much space stand has be set out from wall or corner quite bit clearance purposes ended up returning these stands would definitely buy again if they produced more upright version
367	 great tremolo pedal very quiet when used correctly there absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever can blend tremolo type from smooth sinuous pulsing waveform sharper edged off type tremolo tremolo varies volume sound does vary pitch control over depth or amount effect can control how fast effect pulsates sound very simple popular effect wouldn want live without some form or another pretty teal green color all boss products they built like tank generally last forever if they abused or damaged no idea how fast pedal eats batteries because use power supply there no off clicking when depressed there no added hiss hum or distortion battery compartment easily accessed without having unplug anything simply great effect quality product from boss tends hold its resale value well probably best single thing cable has going lifetime warranty owned planet waves cables past twice sent them back replacement no problems whatsoever price paying about dollar per foot get good quality cable good cores shielding heavy duty retention at jack connector ends best worst good enough live stage gigging probably won notice much difference if recording haven noticed any rf hum or noise when moving about these cables they also come set colored bands so can easily identify which cable goes where cable owner etc affordable price lifetime warranty make feel good purchase would recommend these cables will buy again without going extremes spending two hundred bucks an nos tube from recommend us frugal individuals go cheaper route until get your first platinum hit jj tubes well trusted become defacto standard when selecting quality tested reliability btw 12axt ecc83 same tube can remember last time had jj tube go microphonic beyond control played full time over years use these hope helps ordered these gibson songwriter deluxe ec custom vintage they seem little bit thinner slightly smaller heads micro touch longer than stock pins from gibson pins measure 28mm or inches length was going return them figured would try them out gibson blues king l parlor sized was about same result little too thin smaller heads slightly longer went ahead tried them glad did didn think after using tusq bridge came stock from gibson would make any detectable difference was wrong can tell slight difference did remove strings just loosened them so was compared set was which were fresh from yesterday small amount improvement sustain high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable they also provide graph packaging info think was test using both tusq pins replacement saddle if haven changed your saddle do now get rid soft plastic one must admit did order these about dressing up mind any amount tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated expected got both white paua dot inlay looks very nice provides eye candy was seeking although there no care taken match dots consistency they will vary appearance tusq pins being wee bit smaller seem slide down all way right away need be pushed all way into slot while stringing up heads set flush bridge mount compared gibson stock plastic pins stick up little higher do wish tusq pins were same size will see how well they do blues king most likely will order new pins songwriter deluxe once they pass test time playing month or two don expect them cause any problems should provide extra sustain ringing very much appreciated any small amount or fashion if doubt consider changing your strings brand might be more suited tone mind be darker brighter softer louder etc strings make big difference find using d addario phosphor bronze strings very bright ringy last long affordable seem noticeably louder than ghs or ernie ball steel strings only does apply nylon or gut strings once again if plastic saddle or nut then these pins might make much noticeable difference then again they might make all difference world just try them see they inexpensive pretty well worth risk ordered three these so far very affordable good quality made canada keeps wireless unit very snug tight easy out velcro retaining strap all leather use little plastic flat ring bottom loop strap through which keeps tight against strap width slots inch or approximately mm wide leather will bend little allow slightly larger tighter fit these much better than suspected few expensive levy classic padded straps they fit each other like glove very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdy if click item go product page uploaded some photos actual use close ups fits nicely tight standard wide threaded microphone stands if smaller screw headed ends your microphone stand can get little threaded adapter at any music store next nothing maybe dollar if they don just give using stands heavy round base takes up less space onstage other places well making easy relocate keep out way no need tripod stand legs folding up out getting way plus most inexpensive tripods cheaply made very light will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them base screws down all way onto stand until hand tight set screw allows tilting turning adjustment camera set screw presses against ball socket hinge has plastic thumb knob seems little fragile am very careful over tighten fear twisting off plastic thumb tightening knob am also leery stripping set screw or threads inside housing at price guess can expect sophisticated adjustment mechanism eh there notch side housing allow degree preset angle metal thumbscrew attaches base camera adapter has rubber washer well thin rubber mat acting like cushioning gasket when tightened your camera be careful metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from holding plate when transporting removing or switching cameras found little plastic threaded washer like ring screws onto holding plate screw when use could easily find many types washers screws plastic pieces etc hold place when storage or transport could also leave attached your camera either way be careful let fall out get lost overall little thing quite solid heavy sturdy takes up little no real estate does great job at being small basic solid inexpensive holds well when bumped or moved mine has absolutely no slop does wobble or come loose would put larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera adapter most modern devices will do just fine again just make sure tighten up just enough hold well don put grip hercules should last years mine has m happy mine bought our drummer one christmas hope helps if ordering these replace one or two your gibson speed knobs will want replace all four because they identical gibson all fairness these could possibly be better than gibson stock seem be made more solid underside numbers little bit smaller only reason gave them four stars fit perfectly cts potentiometers if replace all four them nobody except will know lol all four mine were fine no apparent flaws or defects opposed other reviews if get these they aren perfect send them back until get perfect set free hope helps much else say
368	 ve played pedal while now really dig m old school fender blues deluxe reissue strats teles pedal has great warm organic feeling tremolo use lot can barely bring some warmth or really crank speed depth great sort rotary speaker effect ll use rate set at tempo song record clean chords up middle neck effect will give nice almost hammond b type organ sound they good ends they do feel little flimsy cord side things they good signal though don seem alter tone them all pedalboard now so time will tell if they hold up or they call these mini tuners me they just right some tuners too big bulky looking imho installed them prs se santana just few minutes they were direct drop ins use them simply grab top turn until clicks then line hole up center headstock insert string then turn tuning peg ll feel lock then about another quarter turn string tune they really good tuners think anyone will be pleased tuning stability they offer could go days best things about ezd endless ezx packs can add fact all drum grooves mic each drum well room overhead mics which give live organic sound can never get loops can edit grooves fills via midi if need too add cymbals etc really really an amazing program best money ever spent great pedal very well made fairly compact so fit pretty well small pedal board also like tone lot bear mind like more vintage tones crisp crystal clear tone like d get digital delay got more warmth there great video yt from proguitarshop com demos very well got great short long delay very smooth feel mod switch adds just right amount modulation your tone make tad fuller bright sounding delay can be tad dark at times if re careful use long delay sounds use another delay short slap back echo sounds mooer micropedal they work well together too get huge fuller ambient type sound going put mooer before mxr chain use all pedals right into front amp there no effects loop hope helps your decision if like warm old school tones ll dig pedal
369	 own three units capable tremolo boss tr line mm4 boss sl slicer like tremolo steroids plus amp twin reverb so too has tremolo if unfamiliar tremolo modulates volume if turning up down rapidly boss tr simplest three stompboxes operate three controls rate modulation depth modulation how much does volume vary wave shape jagged square or somewhere continuum between unlike other boss stompboxes own ce ph tr does seem compress sound so seems like re playing fishbowl another reviewer puts wave control what gives unit its sonic versatility so nice feature most tremolos all price can give decent set classic tremolo sounds nothing too crazy unit tom morello uses guerilla radio does well tremolo classics like smiths how soon now hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest something am sensitive because generally turn modulations off over course song rather than leave them full time like all boss stuff box sturdy like their big quiet footswitches over any little clicky ones other units color sort dull military dark green most attractive thing bad either small boss effects do come power cable so will factor into cost boss instructions tell need their particular adapter don know anyone who says must run off pedalboard power supply seems work fine if didn would buy boss product period bottom line gives decent array basic tremolo sounds nothing crazy bad price factor power cable simple operate nice casing footswitch drab color mxr phase classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen at present own an mxr phase boss ph phase shifter line mm4 modulations modeler few phaser patches so can compare these three units phase has single speed control sets rate phase so simple use if there single knob good indicator manufacturer feels pretty good about sound unit case agree mxr phase by far cheapest these three units opinion also gives best sound within its capabilities actually seems boost volume slightly boss ph gets slight volume drop workable line mm4 has volume drop me hard use pedalboard because usually don leave modulations an entire song turn them off different sections unless its chorus three phase has least versatility can imitate phase sound both other units line mm4 does slightly better job both ph mm4 more sonic possibilities also boss ph will give lot more spacey extremes than phase which stays normal range again three mxr phase sounds best three at what can do bottom line classic pedal at great price great sound slight volume boost simple use limited sonic possibility safe or normal sounds no crazy extremes beautiful bright orange color can miss compact size does eat up pedalboard space own several electro harmonix pedals overall like brand even though owner appears me be sexist pig clown boy many his youtube videos those own two them smaller versions gigantor classic e h pedals one them being little big muff first all if no idea difference between fuzz overdrive distortion should look into before buy anything these effects used different musical styles produce different sounds so your choice will depend what exactly plan do do some research by looking youtube looking at dave hunter book effects testing them out at store if looking basic fuzz box little big muff will give nice sound similar if same big muff pi depending exact year model think tone great most basic fuzz boxes there only so many different sounds can get out them simple use though makes lot noise bonus these don take up lot pedalboard space compared big muff pi yet will give same tone great punk alt rock grunge classic hard rock like hendrix black sabbath also germanium red dunlop fuzz face mini another good small version one classics fuzz face mini gives most low end emphasis three blue silicon aqua hendrix models boost treble more quickly compare little big muff regarding sound fuzz face does tone control think gives better control over fuzz saturation while little big muff will give more control over tone eq like many ehx pedals goes from zero crazy rather quickly case when begin turning sustain long before very fuzz saturated zone increase amount saturation get more sustain less control dynamics so all your pick attacks begin sound same so d say while both red dunlop fuzz face mini little big muff good tools each comes its own disadvantages though some e h units come power supply one does will need get one unless like changing batteries although few pedals come power supplies think its lame include them will need factor into cost unit if into looking at pretty pedals your board then might be able find prettier fuzz box than stark dreary industrial looking little big muff like pretty things sound unit too good pass up great tool your kit bottom line gives classic big muff fuzz sound does eat up pedalboard space like old gigantor models noisy always good way when has true bypass when off has tone control eq sustain saturates very quickly so get less fuzz control limits dynamic control your picking simple use limited sound palette decent price power supply sold separately bleak appearance shiny colorful or sparkly when do reviews consider how well does stompbox do what does versus price give mxr custom comp five stars because while sounds nowhere near good nor easy use keely will pay substantially less other hand sounds better than boss cs more versatile than an mxr dyna comp also cheaper than mxr vintage compressor which has no led or ac adaptor so think mxr custom comp worth considering when shopping compressor should watch demos youtube many stores sell mxr so can try one out if want an inexpensive compressor led ac adaptor versatile sound palette then mxr custom comp pretty good anyone who argues compression does change your tone has fully explored potential compressor if would like some evidence consider song like fixx one thing leads another which was created part by cranking compressor up manual gives three settings might try chicken pickin new wave reggae chime bloom each which sounds different mxr custom comp can also give volume boost if wish use function think does so wayyyyy better than boss cs which seems more apt at volume drop crank all way get boost one problem compressor there four control knobs two exterior output sensitivity two interior attack trim order set manual suggests will open up case screwdriver turn two dials inside box because just set new wave reggae 80s sounds funk etc manipulate external controls needed if was playing country would simply switch chicken pickin leave if playing multiple styles would seek different compressor like knob keely second problem mxr custom comp noise if crank output up creates buzz rig can be taken care noise gate dyna comp does same thing did hear much keely or boss cs find leaving compressor all time sharpens tone without taking over at same time can easily vary sensitivity get different tone sustain can give an awful lot bell like sustain clean sounds works great chorus pedal bottom line nice compressor price especially if want versatile sound palette good volume boost hard work due interior controls dumb generates noisy signal when cranked gives sound like mxr vintage comp less cost plus off led ac adaptor at cheaper price good compressor its price range keely far superior sound pay ok paint job doesn really catch eye
370	 got power danelectro honeytone amp since eats batteries like candy power adaptor so isn too exciting works fine got when was just learning how play was using borrowed first act without any amp wanted see what kind sounds could make was inexpensive fun use sound quality isn greatest be expected can dial quite few different sounds comes sheet showing how make different sounds very light so make sure set floor because will be pulling over cable pulled off table couple times no ill effects wouldn want take any chances write record own music stink at writing drums don play drums don really room drumset really don want spend money drumset see if can figure out great program non drumming one man bands like me midi drums drum sounds from yamaha keyboard just wasn cutting works ableton live no problems tons different grooves sounds like real drummer real drumset very easy use write record own music use microphone vocals acoustic replaced cable came mogami sounds great crystal clear doesn color recordings will pick up ambient noise from front be expected does pretty good job blocking ambient noise from back be sure get pop filter go write record own music when upgraded new computer windows wouldn support m audio fast track pro so had upgrade focusrite scarlett worked right out box replaced stock cable monster cable recordings sound great very easy use just plug microphone or set your levels start rocking
371	 best little pedal adapter ve used ve used many over last three decades exceptionally quiet which many puts out volts which will drive your pedals little more solidly than all brand new alkaline battery won buy new one every dozen hours ve used splitter drive three pedals at four up can hear current drop bit still good thing because reminds me tone comes from fingers box floor sure nice some gilmouresque delay little extra gain driving tubes best 9v adapter pedals available know including boss ones dan has released some cool well made pedals past years little wall wart worthy companion very good deal at clams we geetarists funny bunch we ll change out pots caps pups from our axes amps all day long spend fortune doing sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks case point pure nickel strings time was when was all there was gee whiz was time when good tone ruled coincidence nope these things just sound better if by better mean warmer subtle feel your fingers will convey your brain milliseconds if re used wrapped strings like play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything metal these might be all need make your rig sound whole lot sweeter smoother just more musical general especially if use tubes tubes pure nickel like gilmour strats or angus sgs they just fit m nuts about fender acoustic strings like their normal electric strings fine though ernie ball slinkies been go tos many years these fender pure nickels very very nice at they re real deal most pure nickels run nearer ten these sound pretty much same don seem break many em neither if re used mixed alloy pure nickels might seem little dull wait bit ll find harmonics still there when alloys faded plus feel just smoother nicer under fingertips try set see what mean subtle beautiful main reason love these playing at volume turned modded hot rod deluxe up call cops levels neighbors getting used by now louder than drummer by good chunk got less squealing warmer tone by far full chords triads double stops felt sounded smoother grinded more harmonic warmth than any alloy string ve ever used think there an electrical cohesion between pure nickel good pups tubes simply sublime check out bb tone legendary live at regal hear what mean stuff so if haven tried pure nickels spend buck or two more or maybe less than normally do give these bargain priced nickels try might find re convert within seconds know ears sure love them when things really cranked up those zep jimi riffs just sound feel so much more right pure nickel digging into some otis rush or billy gibbons licks like night day bluesy stuff just begs pure nickels hell bargain at less than five bucks love small amps played many them over last years still own few favorite being first super champ from early 80s rivera nailed one naturally prefer tubes true tone tried one these out last year at pal place was sold within two minutes bought one six months ago after playing almost daily since then can say without doubt most versatile solid state practice amp ve ever used money crazy deal never once used included online stuff or ableton software so those add even more value package no doubt all wanted was warm up amp real tone plenty more all time favorite tone clean glassy fender late 50s early 60s sound typified by bassmans twins deluxes pre cbs era tone needs tubes really sing amazement amp modeling mustang comes amazingly close sound without tubes ll always miss tube sag crispness snap all there especially bassman settings strats sound so damn good through clean settings prs absolutely smokes real lease breaking volume super sonic dial gain way back nice low throttle roar having gain volume master lets dial ton tones each amp model two separate effects knobs let add chorus tremolo etc plus various reverbs delays etc though find myself keeping everything totally clean time goes by if can get tone want fingers then need learn how motto amp so accurate can above all mustang musical small amp real feat clams near miracle add built tuner most useful extra any amp can good effects great amp models software more online amp models which ll get around one day so far get all tone need from amp plus watts lots headroom straight up steal bill only thing missing serious bass at volume an after all so ll always miss some real bottom what there solid tight only craps out at top volume only rock drummer will need more roar than provides could easily do quiet jazz folk gigs puppy all told mustang easily only best value practice amp them all out there now crate line etc don come close paired mini strat would be absolutely perfect beginner set up kid looking play anything from beatles metallica everything between can recommend highly enough anyone who thinks real tone can come small solid state amp can does cheaper than can still believe fender truly went one leo would be proud ve been using slinky regular nickels over years electrics love them ve tried various coated strings etc always come back ernie sound value acoustics been d addario j 16s since day one still never had one bad set out over hundred adore sound reliability so why never tried their e git strings because slinkys perfect must say so these just put set one strats they snappy yet too bright could want they really complement single coil tones especially out phase positions so if re strat fan love tone give these shot one thing was odd problem was how long these few inches longer than most electric strings fact no idea why if huge posts like mega wraps here your puppy only do triple wrap max so just more cut hardly an issue no matter what coated string fans say those might stay clean longer brand new string zing only lasts few hours any string coated or so if re recording need maximum harmonics overtones or playing big gigs where tone everything say stick uncoated strings aside from slinkys these best ve played starsmy main concern adapters like sound quality d often weak there sometimes too much latency be useful multi tracking apogee covers both areas well little puppy d quite smooth transfers signal near perfectly little much bigger than jack if bon scott only knew small though may be there plenty signal processing power there while doesn stand up best outboard gear offers very clean clear sound transfers from bass keys line mics so can do good sounding entire tunes your laptop only jam interface which yet another step forward high quality home recordings like thought we re getting closer folks releasing things entirely by themselves their own sites paying crapple huge chunk profits merely hosting file record companies file hosts increasingly due tech like jam maybe soon enough we ll see artists keeping all profits from their art imagine offers very close studio quality keep mind even bit solid state once ve used good tube preamp know what difference warmth can make ran through one mine b made very obvious old school studio gear still has its place speaking crapple ads suggest istuff only which true ran ultimate worked charm so don be fooled by typically proprietary ads which cook co probably insist don mention anybody us offer no alternatives they must stay our universe well needn works almost anything so don be fooled by ad copy only negative can find little chintzy outer build making one wonder how good internals how long they ll hold up stronger more solid sleeve would been nice especially at price does sound good though may be used portable purposes might want wrap transport little hand towel or such make sure shocks don mess take care your recording equipment will take care your music play bass gitpicker me envies full time bassists because they almost never break strings bass strings hold their tone far longer than strings price has also come down where can spend well under hundred bucks year strings always fresh tone rich harmonics don know how good ve got these d ad very good all round strings though they make lot more noise than flatwounds even normal nickel wound so they re sloppy fingers very nice funky players those who want more definition edge these flexsteels ring nicely like bottom e tad thicker at than usual light set because these pretty bright extra oomph nice m big believer amp can fix string issues much more easily bass than so merely dialing out little treble or even rolling off volume bit your bass will take care if re popping slapping these come through loud clear really like feel low e when thumb pop these play p bass index middle thumb these punch nicely at scale length pickups also like them they get plenty loud full definition plenty top end brittle trace elliot or other high def amp these would be very unforgiving all most exact players bet marcus would kill them think these perfect funk excellent almost all rock styles obviously flats better jazz these make good all around string less than clams they re great deal

409	 first attempt at buying polishing cloth guitars tried untreated microfiberpolish cloth gibson es because had heard good things about we ll begin some stats cloth by has an border stitched aroundthe edge feels very soft touch made korea there small warning theback package states designed cleaning electrical devices can also washthis untreated polish cloth mild soap water rinse out hang up dry now thereview has an ebony hard lacquer finish meaning very glossy shiny been playing thisguitar about year now had lot finger smudges body front back backof neck was able get most minor finger smudges off when going after moreresistant multiple smudges polish cloth would spread around left most problem onthe finish what discovered about cloth even increased elbow grease has limitations so if your reasonably clean smudges fairly new cloth dynamite takesthem right out if body oils been there awhile probably collecting dust then willneed some type cleaning liquid help break up old fuzzy oils your instrument pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying surface your instrument do put liquid directlyonto surface your instrument should put cleaning liquid onto cleaning cloth firstthen apply decided use dunlop dunlop formula polish cleaner cut clean up tougheroily smudges used another soft cotton cloth cleaned up very nicely since then beenable keep polished clean using only planet waves microfiber polish cloth doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without liquid also did problems thecloth breaking down leaving lint or pieces cloth behind want use another cloth clean your fretboard same one use finish fretboard gets lot oily dirt assigned through repeated play would be fearful theadditional oils accumulated fret board will get into microfiber cloth transfer finishof so like lot things life there limitations everything gave untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because does fine job keeping clean polished minimal effort highexpectations based upon blurb were cloth would clean up more ensconced oils dirtbut only smeared them around was more trouble than was worth use microfiber cloth toclean up smeared mess nonetheless like cloth recommend upkeep purposes minor dirt or grime will bekeeping case just particular finish use each time am done playing what can say has been said about other drs used they rock roll andbend greatest ease once broken course if want mellower bluesier stringwith decent sustain try dr pure blues decided use fender tele hollow body because company puts 9s their guitars didn want worry about nut being wrong size causing untold noises so stuckwith 9s hey rev uses size does matter when comes strings tone other reason pure nickels was tone down ice pickiness one can get from p 90pick ups pure nickels seem mellow out me bit one more reason nickel iseasier your frets which good thing steel will wear down your frets lot faster will say very first set dr pure blues went bad after few weeks windings brokeon d string at two places where string fretted reason kept going back dr bluesis had one problem any electric guitars solid bodies another hollow body since then giving dr second chance convinced me they will last very firstuse was fluke if want strings an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go dr pure blues allegedly they supposed help give vintage tone because prior mid smost strings were made nickel during wwii nickel was short supply so steel was used tomake strings or so historical theory goes gradually nickel wrapped steel strings then pure nickel strings came back into vogue playersbegan searching old vintage sound achieve vintage tone am sure would alsoneed right amp right touch get point am necessarily looking vintage tone love how easily these strings bend how long they last your exact mileagemay differ also never had anything rub off strings onto fingers only time get fingersdirty after oiling fret board there usually some residual oil left no matter how much wipethe fret board definitely strings though also never heard any string squeak from thestrings would give me pause either any string even acoustic will squeak occasionally withan electric who knows if pickups were set too high or nut cut right or wrong sizestring used nut well there go what experienced dr pure blues nickel wrap round core strings willalso say forums frequent more people giving dr kudos their customerservice well their strings so if do get bum string give them holler now get out thereand play your heart out oh how about working vintage tone while at fun if want an inexpensive pure nickel string get thedr strings pure blues pure nickel wrap round core they feel nice nicer your frets sound smooth mellow blues or any genre they bendnicely sustain just well know strings can be personal thing there more expensive pure nickels out there butat price point try set these well may be surprised rated set at stars because only after about hours practice d string windingbroke at second third fret gibson standard no damage frets was easilydiscovered because string sounded dull almost dead strange recently went electric again after years so electric strings basically new experiencefor me again said never had an acoustic wound string its winding come loose over 30years playing put another set electric had no further problems heard happeningto anyone else maybe its no big deal so no one remarks update am still using dr blues guitars had any further problems withthem update just had d string windings break new set different broke onthe same frets reported above was looking cleaner polisher get grease grime off guitars decided trythe dunlop formula polish cleaner thought why try formulation after all thereare shampoo conditioners one bottle works well me so why possiblyfaulty logic went at time well say did well used soft cotton cloth placed some formula cloth slowly worked more oily looking areas gibson es guitarmodel has high gloss black lacquer finish dunlop polisher cleaner did very good job thefinish did leave any streaks behind was after using substance all over realized one must get formula 65in any cracks or chips am thankful did any said cracks or chips am usually oneto read directions thoroughly time no harm done will make point inspect myguitars cracking or chipping prior using formula again stuff works well was able lift off some effort greasy build up over last year amnot messy person oily hands can often leave smudges mar surface finish notonly does clean up oils from hands gosh knows what else also left nice shine well finish looks very good 4oz bottle will go long way doesn take much work tried using an untreated micro fiber polish cloth only pushed oily mess around iswhen decided get dunlop polisher cleaner definitely worked lot easier than un treated micro fiber cloth am now using micro fiber cloth rub off any new smudges theyoccur plan re apply cleaner polisher when oil fret board couple times year

411	 product must why because makes strap install removal so simple reliable when strap clipped into place secure ve owned numerous straplok systems various bass guitars ve owned would ever own an instrument without installing system finally winder has features durability designed into pocket winder head appears be large enough handle any tuning peg head size molded plastic body appears be thick enough stand up lot use pivot point doesn bind when using winder has couple other cheaper models ve purchased thrown away over years string cutter great feature appreciated works well regardless string composition type stainless chromes core types etc price seems fair enough ve seen couple battery powered models much more money if re big hurry change strings re living life too fast get roadie do why remember carry spare batteries up until few years ago had been using same old brand d been buying years then tried recipe dunlop wonderful does everything product description tells about excellent cleaner both wood painted natural metal use clean only body tuning heads bridge bass no nasty residue build up over time cleans polishes just like was designed do without streaking so ll like stuff better than anything ve used date or at least think so sure do bass playing has gone years during time ve tried lots strings many bass guitars know from experience how quality construction strings has improved over decades set d addario chromes remarkable flat wound string all smoothness quiet character found string type set especially like 4th string at dia set by its design gives very strong powerful signal amp therefore makes even schecter diamond series string sound largely like early p bass bottom spare there however string muddy sounding like many flat wounds clean bold full smooth overtones work well really like them price fair we ll see what kind life they exhibit don want be spending lots hard find cash new strings at frequency aggravating don p bought pedal board needed power wires bought kit just super one spot provides power needed wiring just right pedals ve installed great set all ll need get your pedal train wired running nothing makes customer more mad than buy something just doesn work well case here power supply well made durable performs specs supplied guess person can take risk buying variable output adaptor proper power pin configuration why go all trouble product lives up calling besides who wants keep changing batteries stobe tuner planet waves when power adaptor easy plug forget gave star rating because price fair product well made works was shipped well within promised time by today standards good gets dp here what ll need know about product if re interested getting one head accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due slot config good thing trigger rocker switch so can wind unwind quickly good thing most part variable speed one speed fast rpm takes some practice patience nothing special just will get used initially until get used ll head jumping off peg don fret bad pun few minutes rehearsal ll get like ve opted pull trigger short bursts so refrain from having string change remind nascar tire change pit especially because when get close desired tension need go slowly so over run would much preferred device has two position switch slow fast position trigger more control ve rated stars because there anything wrong or doesn work does all advertisements say will aspect device had find out hard way keeps me from giving perfect score all all be patient all will be well realistically don need change set strings just couple minutes ve got hours if chose suspect most folks same position if re roadie big group could see need need speed alas m so like some other things ve purchased along way now new toy works m satisfied now dp cable great material boots just right lot strength durability price right sure m tour any group play church every couple weeks local nursing home other musicians willing give their time plus an occasional gig town celebration or some such activity ve got few sound effects pedals processors like using enough warrant buying your typical pedal board holds or more such devices takes up lot trunk space car mini pedaltrain easily holds four favorite devices built extreme durability without being too heavy etc case awesome too heavy duty good stuff board came velcro tie wraps power head etc mount use your devices had up running few minutes makes travel play experiences easy without looking roadie get help angle mounting surface board relative floor surface perfect clearances passing

from just handling musician over four decades ve owned number tuners technology progressed primary instrument electric bass finest piece equipment ve ever purchased used has helped me solve mysterious tuning phenomenon all players apparently face without knowing ll explain first some details about tuner construction extremely solid heft gives stability when place surface top your amp floor your knee stays there secondly large backlit display very easy read all lighting conditions no guessing thirdly extremely sensitive accurate which brings me explanation mysterious tuning phenomenon at issue inability inexpensive tuners properly identify frequencies tones when setting string intonation at octave fret ve been using tuners boss korg etc over past few years would indicate string tune both open string octave when simultaneously plucking an f note string an f note high up g string ear would percieve they just weren tune cycles weren matching so meant inexpensive tuner wasn nearly discriminating enough once began using strobe tuner clearly showed me proper accuracy graphically what ear was trying tell me after setting intonation according strobe tuner bass now performs should through range notes frets over length neck guess another way explaining would be say like having gps accurate enough get right neighborhood versus one can get right house money feel ve done myself good turn by purchasing strobe tuner m satisfied still keep one inexpensive tuners case has built microphone can be used by an accoustic player if m jamming somebody strobe tuner cable input only no mic runs 9v battery connectors power supply sold separately only complaint device battery connector typical type plugs top your 9v battery two wires leading internals hate them rule would prefer solid contact points compartment where would simply insert battery just like inserting any other battery type aa aaa c etc

423	 ve been using these picks years they ve always been great between these blues yellow m covered ve had few these life time because people always steal capos what hell anyway capo works well ve only used gibson fender electrics does fine job some rubber padding will eventually come off glue wears off does affect capo abilities m sure there better ones me works well been using these years like regular slinkies too seems these tend last longer or could just be head either way am happy them between blue yellow needs covered these weird feeling when first get them like they powder them within minutes using ll stick much better love these picks
424	 very first thing noticed about design how far from surface strap actually connected what tells me there considerable added stress screw wood surrounding because added leverage weight fulcrum surface wood if makes sense can help wonder if could eventually eventually over much time use cause cracks or splits result found someone selling only dunlop strap buttons which great idea someone main straps several guitars was about order them when found planet waves elliptical end pins think best idea yet keeping strap unless re going be spinning around your shoulders no additional stress body ve ordered set if plan use pedal traditional volume pedal volume pedal amp configuration inserting effects pedals anywhere like poorly engineered pedal can be true bypass long signal travels through potentiometer they can use pots virtual short when adjusted properly pedal forward anyway difference between plugging directly into amp placing pedal chain between amp immediately noticeable tone becomes duller output drops would expect from an asian knock off from an list gear maker might be over stating ernie ball reputation though they make some fine guitars gotta say ve used their strings many years if plan use eb pedal digital effects should be fine because digital device will take two measurements pure resistance at either end rocker signal processing takes place unit pedal those units their own tone problems another review does occur me any pedal buffer true bypass other words may fix problem which more than likely related impedance like tuner pedal between volume pedal will need try out does excuse ernie ball from their responsibility major fail their part stars generous because eb fails honor simple first do no harm principle harms your tone how dumb pedal itself very attractive appears indestructible though doubts about their string mechanism over time rocker feels smooth weight gives pedal stability floor no recommendations volume pedal because feel esthetics do plan keep digital device use wish was able do what promises fails so miserably deliver pedal board replaced bcb6 boss case because lot non boss pedals wanted start using them gigs pt2 footprint large enough accommodate lot pedals too big smaller gig except some smallest stages room corners do require smaller rig without going into specifics there was zipper issue soft case wrote company described problem lizzie wrote back said she d take care just don get better service than company provides combine great product design m happy customer larger boards give option installing dedicated power supply underneath one its best features truly plug play yes spent more than ever pedal board before portability reliability flexibility if was ever going use best pedals gigs was tried skb furman they some nice features if like lot plastic still like pt2 much better agree other reviews boss exploits its customers by insisting pedal psa supply sells separately cheesy way meet price point without really doing used onespot power supply had already works fine just glad didn shell out more boss something they should provided me70 first thing noticed tuner too good get letter an arrow each side very responsive korg style dial reverb controls easy extremely limited expected better get either room or hall neither realistic going from manual patch level bank level awkward may just take practice next thing noticed delay level does respond expected if set e level delayed signal level or balance at around thirty can be clearly heard when overdrive or boost added primary signal boosted expected delayed signal remains at original volume effectively reducing balance making delayed signal nearly inaudible did boss just start making multi effects pedals they learned nothing despite somewhat mediocre performance design me70 does features recommend some drives usable controls accessible easy adjust solo setting comp fx module nice booster although can apparently be overdriven easily by boost od ds module maybe by design would be nice two levels clean boost next annoyance very limited capabilities optional footswitches was hoping be able flip between preset manual setting all does turn preamp off or step one way through presents fs 5u almost appears boss very cynically crippled me70 so did threaten gt10 sales m looking forward learning more about pedal so far does some good things could be much better has anyone else noticed me70 reviews out there aren too useful m thinking checking out vox tonelab ex which being blown out now at gc example update despite limitations above like portability unit runs aa think which great when just want put floor play example at jam where don power nearby new fail update tremolo unit just stinks mean stinks whatever waveform sine wave smooth at all very poor musical characterists whatever engineer was charge screwed up big time your own boss tremolo pedals much better than what ve put me70 why would do boss like tremolo virtually useless unit some people won notice if like swampy fender style tremolo will be very disappointed love stand am really disappointed cheap designed fail bolt hardware used adjust telescoping rear leg think stand can last long time if don adjust much how much better would been had they designed one those pressure collars flip tab so limited holes drilled into rear leg other hardware isn much better list price stand stage took cheap route rather than quality route well only an stage product hercules k m or atlas or ultimate support cheap stuff budget brand trying

427	 using yamaha dreadnought acoustic goes one easy feels sturdy thinking about ordering another an acoustic electric update ordered another seagull acoustic electric like first one works great tend sweaty fingers after playing guitars therefore after playing always wipe down strings extend their life ve used other microfiber cloths they tend break easy leave fuzzies strings which then remove one by one cloth fantastic wiping down your strings after use very well made leaves nothing behind after use liked first one so much am putting another order
428	 dunlop dual design straplock system sturdy fairly easy assemble easy install alternative straps slipping off instruments screws used attach straplok heavy gauge pretty large there little chance these going come out locking mechanism seems like secure should require little maintenance only disadvantage dunlop system schaller system dunlop sticks out measurably farther from body ordinarily seems like should be only most minor inconveniences an instrument such hofner violin bass though or any strap button back instrument makes difficult hold body instrument against your body support schaller strap locks might look little more elegant some players dunlop straplok system sturdy should provide long life service can be found at better price than several its competitors recommended most body styles after suffering through crackles lost signals all rest decided heed numerous positive reviews spectraflex tweed cable purchase one through amazon com because new acoustic electric classical received gift has an end pin outlet bought spectraflex right angle connector although been using cable only few weeks am very impressed connections all guitars basses which ve used sure no loss signal no crackles perhaps most impressive fact can turn right angle connector around never any change signal finally can be confident when play something will consistently come out amplifier by way old school tweed look plus too put set elixir nanoweb custom light strings main acoustic maybe couple months ago although don play gigs play just about every day or maybe every other day custom lights wonderful great durability nice tone projection easy fingers bought set elixir extra lights laguna size travel reasoning was lighter body shorter scale could use lighter strings thereby putting less stress body compared light d addario strings came these more muffled low e string string too doesn project much standard strings although ve tried extra lights full sized acoustic suspect there too lower strings would presence or ring other brands even custom light set where lower strings heavier gauge than normal light set bass notes slight hint muffled quality thing most players elixirs seem talk about playability durability they smoother feeling than non coated strings certainly don degrade because perspiration nearly quickly regular strings other thing important know though elixirs excellent at holding tune once they re stretched broken being said m sure would put extra lights laguna again because bass projection issue small has little enough bass begin these strings don help might guessed though m thoroughly convinced about custom lights full sized acoustic ve owned seymour duncan woody several months now had chance try out various amps pickup tipped stronger low end or high end so an excellent value basically feedback free re likely get from an acoustic pickup one thing ve found get significantly more natural acoustic sound playing woody through ampeg bass amp than through peavey amp high ends too grating through an electric amp there tendency distortion creep even clean setting through bass amp though tone absolutely clean clear pickup easy enough install remove easy get sit low enough doesn interfere finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would other great feature pickup look natural wood finish actually enhances look if looking an acoustic pickup one buy good basic set regular light gauge electric strings difficult go wrong d addario exl110s range thicknesses generally works well d addarios tend be pretty consistent some other brands may offer special features go beyond what get exl110s e g coating super brightness so some players prefer slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string e g sets start 9s or 11s most purposes these work great hold their tuning well seem last pretty well too purchased stage brand microphone stand use theremin although may use at some point purpose which was designed substantial stable very solidly built stand base heavy enough can image stand would fall over normal use should need arise also easy disassemble assemble highly recommended recently purchased two protec straps order avoid having switch straps between instruments these straps quite flexible length wise so if ever been disappointed by strap either couldn get short enough high playing position or long enough low playing position will be disappointed here these also nice medium width so they should be suitable all kinds players although one reviewer complained about size holes strap buttons actually find snug fit be an advantage doesn feel like ll worry about strap coming disconnected from price right elixir nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings best strings ve ever used alvarez acoustic ve now owned over years they certainly longest lasting strings seem be out there they nice punchy tone easy fingers unlike elixir extra lights found be lacking bass just tad mushy side short scale these seem like an ideal combination may buy another set soon restring short scale instrument lights compared some brands gauges more old school strings there may be little less bass response these sound good pretty even through set convenience having change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues one might ping low e string dampit humidifiers been around years years think can safely say basic design looks be amazingly similar what remember when saw these first time university days late 1970s generally dampits can be used over over years sometimes rubber becomes discolored sometimes rubber rips near end dampit basically very workable way maintain at least minimum amount humidity around your instrument something especially important during winter months when artificial heat zaps humidity out air first instrument specific dampit product ve ever purchased seems work exceptionally well addition standard dampit there sound hole cover case clear just how works clear sound hole cover has short string loop end simply attach dampit loop hangs inside first impression does an excellent job keeping some needed humidity body instrument something very important solid top classical would recommend over standard dampit because sound hole cover so convenient hopefully will continue keep me from having fish around inside runaway dampit seems keep humidity focused an area especially need must if keep your acoustic an environment gets much below humidity there fair number similar tripod stands out there about same cost if one your pet peeves some these u shaped support falls out when carry assembled stand around then ll especially like world tour stand way u shaped piece inserts makes far less susceptible falling out although one other reviewer put minimalistic stand has substantial feel m quite happy purchase would buy another world tour again rather than one other brands own amazon com did great job too getting out me these d addario silk steel strings excellent finger picking couple notes though positive side they made u american produced materials unlike silk steel strings by famous american company whose name starts m which assembled south border negative side they cost more than m silk steel strings general silk steel strings squeak more position changes than straight steel strings especially more than flat wound acoustic strings tone very nice mellow sort cross between flat wound steel strings nylon strings d addario folk set very easy fingers therefore ideal if play lot or if primarily play fairly light gauge electric string only acoustic occasion they really work best finger picking whatever do don use metal finger picks less effective than steel strings flat picking although hardly high end microphone fully functional amplification voice or an instrument although output signal seems like could be stronger stand sturdy too so probably best choice full time professional musician busking around or playing clubs worth look although through amazon com recently purchased seagull s6 original acoustic compared variety other brands price range well seagull entourage acoustic electric which was also general price range s6 has nicely consistent tone which although maybe little too bright some players tastes projects very well some reviewers guitarists whom ve talked wonder how seagull can produce instruments sound well they do north america price think found part answer when looked inside some seagulls braces do look uniform neatly finished they might other guitars looking at outside listening though d never know find neck width at nut be great fingerpicking work left hand fingering compromise between more standard acoustic neck width classical neck width me works some players who more used more traditionally narrow neck might appreciate attribute seagull does offer other models by way more traditional width slightly shorter scale reminds me scale gibson uses many its electric models just shorter enough better enable chord fingering so short cause floppy strings couldn be happier seagull s6 especially price although purchased lanikai lu ukulele some time ago had chance play hundreds hours despite ve been highly impressed its quality sound some reviewers note nylon strings tendency go out tune pretty quickly fret sharp however more function strings than function ukulele lanikai frets well all way up fretboard although seems be case soprano ukuleles general tends sound better more resonant its lowest range tuners seem solid all four function consistently construction looks be pretty solid well if were going be playing gigs d probably look more expensive presumably higher quality instrument probably would purchase without trying first having some fun workable recommended instrument there no doubt about national fingerpicks pretty much standard metal fingerpicks rock solid sturdy gauge steel plastic thumbpicks match tone very well note unlike what may read another review they adjustable just need heat them up some hot water bend fit resonator these provide full loud sound only reasons me these don rate stars pro pick f tone fingerpicks usually use provide much more sense feel national fingerpicks tendency be little noisier than pro picks unwound strings even though like national metal fingerpicks much better than plastic fingerpicks ve used even though they produce more fullness than pro picks me sense feel get from open finger design pro picks trumps volume important keep mind players whose only fingerpicking experience fingers alone players who already used metal or plastic fingerpicks should give national picks strong consideration they solid sound great packaging them excellent by way bonus pick cute will go logo pick collection very thin gauge be useful me anything other than electric planet waves tuner works effectively acoustic electric guitars using instruments vibrations read pitch tuner seems be reasonably accurate lightweight easy read without being obtrusive audience also nice such an inexpensive small tuner can be adjusted standards either side note photo tuner shows headstock fender style electric works particularly well instrument shown because fact tuners all same side headstock something like gibson jazz es or one epiphone or ibanez clones example more difficult find an ideal place attach tuner classical acoustic steel string guitars also tad problematic too tuner unusable other types headstocks just design limits where can place still readable right side up some headstocks too may be too thick order attach tuner long fits your planet waves tuner highly recommended planet waves d addario artist capo seems like classic case trying do everything quite getting right result capo has micro adjusting knob into consistent acoustic guitars such seagull non standard width fretboards built pick holder useful planet waves offers another less artist model also has one fact other planet waves capo much more amenable different width necks than one artist capo also has an adapter allows player attach one those small clip tuners directly too capo assuming don use capo constantly why would want clip tuner capo instead headstock check out other offerings from planet waves can do better less than one

453	 summary those who don want read whole thing more than worth money if re beginner looking first or if re experienced searching backup travel option or anything like get do hesitate cheap doesn always mean pos alright full story review so when was kid up until early teens insanely talented self taught older brother helped me learn how play got pretty decent somewhere along way stopped ve regretted basically every day ever since then recently decided stop internally griping about realized should actually do something about so here am having previously lived house multiple guitarists heard sounds expensive guitars heard sounds cheapest guitars like typical beginner first act knew there was middle ground was determined find got way more than bargained began quest knowing funds were limited there was no way could afford dive right buy high end top line fender or martin like had had benefit learning back day knew had go cheap at least now began scouring internet search best rated budget guitars after an exhaustive amount research chose one due positive reviews because all demos d pulled up youtube were excellent plus epiphone has pretty good reputation general despite positive reviews was still bit leery buying instruments without actually handling them first always bit gamble even if sounds nice plays well sometimes perfectly solid functional instrument just doesn feel right went through checkout silently reminded myself could send back any reason went into fully knowing there was good possibility d just bite bullet buy something better even if costlier well arrived earlier week am disappointed certainly didn expect perfection was convinced would find some kind error if only cosmetic such cheap am here tell found anything wrong even if had unless drastically affected sound playability instrument would still be worth price along bought some new strings martins because times stock strings come instruments awful was pleasantly surprised find stock strings more than usable see some other reviewers disagree maybe their strings were older or maybe just preference don know all can say stock strings were at all corroded old shockingly enough was pretty close being tune right out box doesn seem any trouble staying tune either all being said wouldn hurt pick up pack strings just be safe mean m sure when do finally put martins ll be even more mind blown than already am way sounds has full rich sound plays comfortably low action helps has zero issues buzzing or dead frets oh contrary what other reviews said yes does truss rod while we re talking about its positives let ignore fact also super attractive its shiny black finish there isn much about would give away its price no certainly doesn play like either don regret purchase at all even future when progress upgrade will definitely be keeping lovely gem if re still unsure do what did listen some demos youtube doubt ll be disappointed pay no mind reviews guy gearwire youtube channel did he clearly doesn know what he talking about well everyone else comments section was sure express feelings about haha one user even claimed epiphone should sue him check out video reviews by users companies goldhat3 samashmusic giggear shadowfw only complaint about didn buy sooner good luck your search hope review has helped holder spring loaded so makes inserting removing picks easy has little sticky tab back so can stick something such at side back your instrument so always know where your picks always them hand don know exactly how many holds thickness picks makes difference ve crammed quite few varying sizes here without issues price steal if can snag pack new strings will sound tremendously better all all new strings only spent about uke think more than fair if can get new strings ones come will survive little while stock strings any instrument never great also if don know how tune an instrument don tuner don need buy one if smartphone or ipod touch there accurate tuning apps nearly any instrument ukulele included little back story used play instruments when was younger stopped preteens early teens something ve recently been regretting more than ever so m fixing only am relearning instruments played before picked up new one ukulele like many others was inspired by amanda palmer do so back review sound ukulele great too tinny like lot cheap instruments after week or so has no trouble staying tune rarely needs adjustments very lightweight which good don think would survive fall fingerprint magnet about only gripe plan sticker ing painting anyway gig bag other said basically just dust jacket m cool because says me majority money spent ukulele really was ukulele extras price ukulele more than serves its purpose was worried d regret shelling out another or more frequently recommended ukelele don regret at all pretty easy learn especially if littlest bit musical knowledge or experience even if don shouldn take too long be playing some songs gift internet where there information everywhere ukelele perfect beginner or someone who wants cheap backup or travel option plus costly so if breaks gets lost stolen choose upgrade haven lost whole lot money would also be great kids who want learn an instrument little brother has been nagging me get him ukulele since got one about all will update if any problems arise time don hesitate if re new don worry about spending something else mean if can want go ahead will be more than fine edit apparently thing fluctuates between was when got if wait few days see if goes down mean worth money if can save little spent extra new pack strings would be even better give stars simply because while played other ukuleles am certain there better just how more spend better definitely pretty solid over all what how much costs don know how much can say about picks versatile pack get multitude types there each thickness if use variety picks or wanting test out other types picks cheap quick easy serves its purpose was so inexpensive almost painful haven had break doesn cause any issues instrument so m more than content handy inexpensive capo

468	 first off costs extra because drum pads which pretty much useless practically hit them hammer get response keyboard feel flimsy they indeed small very playable there no modulation wheel do get crappy unresponsive pads cheap knobs hate mini usb jack since those connections rarely last price do recommend me

nice because don naturally bassy voice m extremely satisfied how well thing makes me sound worlds better than usb mics like blue snowball worlds better heft heavy feels well made might be most expensive feeling device own heavy good way materials feel high quality feels like professional microphone comes mic stand holder thing never say no free stuff cons1 only thing can think doesn come its own cable ll need buy an xlr cable your own bad enough deduct star there people who comparing shure sm57 other microphones here thing am an amateur before owned mic was using blue snowball before laptop webcam mic so am authority all can tell thing sounds freaking amazing podcast co host immediately noticed difference couldn tell me enough how much better sounded over skype call we podcast using skype so if re looking vocal podcast mic great cheap option there better options sure price even close recommended wholeheartedly what we here an xlr male xlr female black cable if re looking some ridiculous review won be one quick pros cons pros1 nice thick cable 25ft long promised measured really worked didn arrive dead consnone really seems like nice high quality cable there better no clue m an amateur needed an xlr go gls es fit bill plugged into mixer plugged into mic transmitted proper audio from one other really all designed do thus stars blue snowball mic stand comes thing entirely too short needs so set out find desk stand microphone could use podcasting video work here pros cons pros1 about twice tall stock stand comes snowball may be too tall some mic put stands tall asus g75vw raised desk so fits right up mouth snowball screws right unscrew holder thing comes there screw snowball win after some research found will fit pretty much any mic cool seems sturdy well built cons1 legs make thing very very wide about size keyboard which means takes up lot space mechanism retract legs little weird bad just weird overall highly recommended desk stand seems be able fit just about any mic perfect video voice overs podcasts first mixer d been looking cheap way upgrade from usb powered mics like blue snowball something little more professional course requires mixer these kinds hookups thus am an amateur ll probably get more accurate ratings out professional anyway pros conspros1 thing way smaller than expected can hold one hand without any difficulty means doesn take up lot desk space fits well where put works intended use gls es mic mixer powerful enough power make sound good windows volume set at gain up at about no hissing no problems did podcast set up today podcast co host we do over skype said sounded very clear voice sounded strong good stark improvement over blue snowball plug play plugged installed drivers automatically set itself default microphone easy peasy use reaper audio software reaper recognized immediately dials everything was easy understand cons1 can plug into usb hub or even an ac powered usb hub otherwise ll get hiss needs be plugged directly into computer high jacks your audio defaults windows fix open your control panel open sound set your playback device your speakers fix problem your sound will come out through your speakers intended since use main mic left default sound settings overall price an amazing little mixer beginners amateurs know there better options they also more expensive m budget great way get into world sound without spending lot more money if re like me single person doing youtube video voice overs or podcasts perfect home studio set up where only need one person worth every penny long lasts

496	 ive had good success piece use straight mic stand topped shure super vocals put heil fin boom arm mic tenor sax arm allows variety positions serves eliminate second stand just horn mic only small concern length arm itself if was bit shorter or adjustable would help offset potential balance issue created from having mic hang far off stand case am using heavy microphone so didn rate down product reason know im pushing issue doubt if someone was attaching lighter microphone arm would be issue said great way get rid second unnecessary stand cluttering up your stage we ended up buying total our stage freed up ton floor space highly recommended piece am professional musician keyboard player keyboard collector mostly vintage poly analog also ton mono phonics modulars built your own kit units shrugging ambik etc has lot do pedal however do live life person surrounded by keyboard instruments use make living purchased every brand style pedal purpose we ll stick sustain compared other units heavier than most find point where sustain engages be just about right comparing electronic acoustic just an off switch so no half modeling here only reason gave unit stars instead because yamaha decided include polarity switch alienate perhaps market who will get home if they hadn thought check may be stuck wi pedal sustains when being used stops sustaining when pressed backward sustain pedal fun many manufacturers include simple polarity reverse switch would eliminate potential headache these days most keyboards option switch polarity internally either thru global bemusement or by sensing whether pedal engaged at startup adjusting accordingly never press sustain pedal while turning your keyboard may very well cause an issue don expect confused by turning off again without pedal depressed will clear everything up those cases so build quality excellent durability excellent ve had bunch cheaper pedals used stage break at switch point or at jack yamaha endures design some older pedals used flip out rubber footrest was supposed make pedal more secure don see much anymore so long aren glossy hardwood will stay place no issue ve read few reviews give pedal bad rating because what appears be change global setting keyboard or something similar all sustain pedal consist momentary contact switch engaged when contact made by depressing completing circuit disengaged when pedal released there no electronics so if doesn work there three points look at unscrew jack be sure wires coming from pedal all connected metal posts inside housing there usually two wires differing color if one disconnected pedal will cease function rare instances cause keyboard sustain all notes indefinitely easily corrected soldering iron bit if solder jacks points strain so isn inconceivable wire could come disconnected switch itself either out if adjustment or damaged switches yamaha pedals good quality unless received faulty part would be unlikely wear out normal use however needed take pedal apart made an adjustment was easy quick fix even limited tools third option keyboard has had change global setting causing pedal operate reverse can be corrected by consulting your owners manual reading whether your keyboard has software polarity switch if senses startup or if pedal simply stopped working altogether doing nothing at all or or problem jack keyboard highly unlikely ve seen happen hopefully helps some who posted questions conclude nice pedal money much better build than m audio decent just nice yamaha certainly bad unit stage if they can get most their mic stands right don trust them even basic electronics or generics title says best decent basic mic cable nothing special like canare or mogami does job non high stress position cable bit thin supple quality thin those high end mic cables will recognize was priced right usd crowded rig already las thing wanted was another mic stand already straight stand shure sh55 mounted talkback call tunes band members wanted eliminate wireless sax mic was using infrequently decided mount heil fin extension arm same stand talkback nice stable no issues works perfectly well built pedal good quality enough weight keep body stable good middle travel execution point sustain correct keyboard pedal will also allow half pedaling very important someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers especially older models pedal does has switch allow polarity adjustment most newer keyboards doesn matter polarity can be edited globally or alternatively polarity sensed startup so long pedal plugged some other pedals particularly those from name manufacturers will only work some keyboards said feel m audio compares favorably most visible competition yamaha fc4 offering yamaha pedal bit heavier which do like subjectively implies better quality reality yamaha did last under same circumstances breaking down needing spot repair after year road last yamaha fc4 does half pedaling option or polarity switch making m audio pedal great all around option case pedal has been live stage unpacked packed tossed around fair bit years no problems bought cable an emergency situation one where was road needed great cable didn access roll own using what would ve been essentially same parts exclusively use canare mogami studio critical places live setup cable itself top shelf quiet will provide years use if treat even modest respect an instrument cable could possibly be little short if move around bunch making worth go cable bass or player if don like being tied down used part keyboard rig where was perfect all levels quality reproduction sound across entire spectrum highs were crystal bass clear connection solid am gold fanatic these excellent great warranty reputation holds value these real deal pro cables opposed some cables priced similarly monster price necessarily superior build or sound which why didn walk into center buy pair monster waited these be delivered overnight instead nice work mat adequate size provides nice non static covering bench grey color makes easy easy see small parts etc opposed some black mats where black objects hard differentiate

soon want put them away something more substantial than gig bag these do very nicely purpose they certainly more than capable taking an instrument gig wouldn put pricey into case if new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going be handling so recommend them be aware its limitations great deal great strings they sound clear bright they last good while quality strings do sound different nearly importantly they feel good too always high quality reasonable price more durable than cheap cables find online less expensive than boutique cables great working man gear so cheap can rely them so expensive can buy number extras don let term nylon fool really nice thick strap nothing like those cheap straps great value matches has cool retro pinstripe flame paintjob does what says will still great pedalboard solution distance between plugs sometimes too short also if re using all plugs ve got dangling end ve got try stash or tie off again good item what does has inherent problems if re

stable even heavy bass drum mic great bargain very sturdy useful product was really looking forward receiving amp read positive reviews ampeg name carries some weight unfortunately from moment plugged there was phaser like effect sound tried different basses tried different cables tried using different places away from computers fluorescent lights tried all different combinations all those things still spacey phase shifter sound came out tried all different knob eq settings well nothing helped so m returning hoping just got bad egg next one will be better used work an amp manufacturer so know these things happen don think less ampeg at least yet really hope better amp because amp itself looks wonderful packed cool features like an effects send cd line out hooking up pa headphone out quiet practice also just looks cool very pro intention use monthly bistro gig where volume low area pretty small so seems absolutely perfect if get one performs like all other reviews see here say buying from amazon only way buy these things online they immediately started process shipping me new one soon filled out return ups label if there choice between amazon com other vendors even if amazon couple bucks more recommend using amazon customer service so easy immediate worth piece mind ll update review when get new amp later week upgraded review based replacement received see below just got today m experiencing serious install issues please note m newbie stuff m an guy new acer computer less than months old new install windows mic recognized sound input device just an other usb device tried installing another laptop installed quickly easily so mic itself doesn work purpose posting let people considering mic know can just assume install no brain r at least pc samson tech support was friendly enough very helpful they had no idea what do next or any suggestions further support support guy said well really all there which can understand still mic won work computer tried contacting microsoft tech support they tried help me too we could never get mic be seen an input device we tried number ways nothing worked ordered use ipad well ordered camera kit do so despite what d seen reviews videos online mic received would work either mic needs be powered by ipad seemed mine was getting enough power from ipad because little indicator light was still amber when plugged indicating getting enough power instead blue tried wife ipad daughter too so would appear be ipad problem though could be camera connector suppose so ended up returning whole shooting match disappointing too really like design mic so many people say sounds so good just can trust thought d be good idea if needed prop up against amp minute just can get myself do always end up using little fender portable stand does make nice coaster placing beer amp let me start by saying used work line so know modeling pedals nearly every modeling pedal line makes was looking minimize rig take me bistro size gigs play most time general all really want vox ac30 tone maybe delay pedal or some other single effect use very small zt lunchbox amp sort thing solid state so basically get nice loud straight ahead tone which nice makes our cover tunes little less authentic sounding heard some sound samples online comparing pedal tech21 liverpool pedal ear there wasn difference very convincing just pair up line m9 can get most any tone need beatles tom petty all tones need love pedal

543	 reviewer who wrote these cheap foam worth doesn understand or appreciate quality these speaker isolators b these some cheap foam will realize how good these auralex isolators work am using pair behringer truth active speakers weigh pounds each these isolators only support them very well solved big problem had seems speakers were audio coupling console they were placed making console vibrate spaekers muddy up lower fequencies problem started when noticed mixes sounded good other systems except bass frequencies around hz apparently behringer speakers were accurately reproducing fequency range was eqing range badly compensate didn hear when mixed hafler m speakers was about give up behringer truth speakers really thought they sounded excellent every other frequency very detailed every other range behringers also had all power needed active speakers can be played really loud studio without any distortion except what can only describe muddy or clearly detailed low end love these speakers fortunately was at friends studio great pro studio saw he was using auralex isolators under his speakers he said he loved them bought them placed them under speakers remixed project had been working wow what difference was an immediate difference bass now nicely detailed muddy tone no longer there had reajust eq lower frequencies cut them back almost flat new mix immediately bought 2nd set small hafler speakers why take chance they were also reproducing accurately these isolators great product problem solver saved me from buying new speakers discovering still had same problem cheap foam don think so used fender thin picks years always either solid black or swirl brown these picks great because when drop them stage or dark club can find them easily liitle box works great needs am using three guitars stage when possible room permitting use mixer combine all three into one output amp way can leave all three guitars plugged take time between songs changing cords such also solves second problem since pick ups each different outputs fender single coils ibanez acoustic fishman piezo les paul gibson humbuckers now volume controls make overall volumes match perfect inexpensive unit made brushed aluminum quiet adds little boost signal velcro small pedal board m glad someone else mentioned c plug theirs being european standard volt us standard don be surprised if happens bought one had same experience got mine from musicians friend they offered me return chose keep since had volt power supply available from an older unit long since stopped using no stars deducted since was manufacturers fault supplier didn check their inventory make sure was us standard pedal does exactly what says supposed boosts guitars signal does really well very little no noise thing like most sledge hammer type pedal or overdrive input signal cleanly boosted what put into input comes out same only louder starts no change signal allows raise up gain very slowly just gives signal from your stronger output whatever plugging into amp mixer effects or pedal board pedal arrived at door friday afternoon so took gig night without trying first something don normally do first two times used pedal were night friday next saturday thought worked great needs few days later read review said pedal had noticable hiss since didn remember hearing any got out at home plugged into amp same amp at home use live when activate tone set flat pedal volume about there very sight hiss no noise when bypassed me very minor hiss live situations all normal room noises never heard at all may be true all amps maybe some high gain input amps may handle signal differently know sure lot quieter than almost any effects pedal ever owned box full from years playing am using vox vt30 which modeling amp lots bulit effects delays chorus flanger compressors etc these days don use any additional outboard effects except bba sonic stomp never turn off so siganl from hits amps input very cleanly if use various guitars gigs pedal very useful allows me quickly match various output levels compensate differences between humbuckers single coils piezo pick ups an acoustic without having adjust amp controls great problem solver any rig needs control input level amp does at bare bones price owned several behringer pedals live work some behringer rack gear live audio rack home studio gig reguarly once twice week faithfully never broken or had problem any behrinnger gear including pair behringer powered speakers mixed pair mackie powered mains don intentionally abuse gear at when your packing up happens so far behringer stuff has never let me down yet had some many years also keep reading about people worrying about hard plastic cases behringer pedals don worry about they sturdy enough just watch out if changing battery dark stage battery goes under pedal switch spring under foot switch will probbaly fall out if careful open battery compartment foot switch cover just use pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver push black pins either side pedal own two these behringer boxes they come two modals use them sonor cakewalk an internal software sound modual roland virtual sound canvas play back midi files live two piece band sound through pa soundcraft mixer mackie active speakers loud very clear most cases no eq needed guess really revolves around your personal needs live performance these behringer boxes excellent price steal do use record home recording done stand alone daw tascam track if live musician or dj using something like virtual dj these boxes great way eliminate low level hum from laptop give dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards years was lugging around large rack case mackie board host rack effects reverb delay compressors etc while using rack had line from programmable effects pedal boss went rack compressor then out little vox amp internal compressor boss me pedal was terrible was very happy set up about years about year ago stopped using rack smaller clubs places too many stairs since then went smaller pa soundcraft gigarac some active mackie speakers started using terrible compressor otherwise decent boss pedal few months ago took out old box effects pedals built small pedal board worked great couldn locate old ibanez cs9 compressor years ago know gave away mxr needed compressor pedal new pedal board worked well alesis seems like found winner mxr clone from behringer seems work well if better than mxr much quieter some people mentioned slight bump upper mids compressed signal agree there hiss or added noise like sound main mid epiphone sheriton sounds great through behringer dc9 can comment durability because haven had long case metal everything feels solid don crank up compression too much leave pedal about time control overall signal from pedal board pedals order ibanez ts9 ibanez super tube pedal was made between ts9 ts10 cheap chorus pedal ibanez de7 delay into behringer dr600 reverb compressor does just what supposed do two knob sqeezer just like old mxr just works no need worry about compression ratios thresholds release points or attack settings two knobs one set overall compression one adjust output volume great simple pedal clean sound update had pedal now about years notice one reviewer said bass sound dropped out his signal pedal admit true huge drop bottom end tone noticeable pedal something would use too heavily does nice job compressing peaks overall range gives nice smooth sound if looking pedal sustain sound may want look at other pedals just basic compressor true sustainer at high levels will probably make sound very thin compression ratio gets above or higher other hand most stomp pedal compressors under will do pretty much same thing alesis rack compressor will knock punch out signal at high levels also sound clean best used little compression huge amounts needed call sustainer try behringer cs400 more sustain own three these units one red two grey use them output midi sounds from laptops internal sound moduals pro pa system mostly mackie gear live performance occasionally add sounds recordings track home studio unit quiet very handy price dead cheap two other similar units lexicon alpha smaller lexicon omega boxes cost much more yes lexicon boxes provide lot different inputs outputs very nice if all need very portable basic input output sound card very quiet easy install just plug should buy box some reviews talk about being cheap plastic yes plastic so many other more expensive units been throwing these boxes other equipment yet break one them or any problems will also admit while don abuse equipment purpose am gentle either dropped these several times no damage software comes package good case really didn need sonor cakewalk software abobe audition would like take moment say something about included audacity one reviewer wrote very low low low quality software couldn be further from truth used software years studio very high quality software can work both bit processing input output almost every type audio format wav mp3 etc also has ton very nice free downloads compressors eq sonic enhancers etc from audacity web site audacity started life shareware was purchased by sound forge who was turn bought by sony high quality studio software can still download use free trial software will expire days or block out important features would add really make work well need use preferences section set up higher quality settings available remember defaults set at mid level quality so average home user can use without taxing their computer resources bottom line both behringer units both work great can hear or see any difference them other than color added software included package such low price can go wrong what more can ask at roughly very useful compressor simple compressor easy understand responsive controls use compressors quite lot pa rack yamaha rack compressor an alesis rack compressor home studio there compressors track daw computer racks deluxe mastering software several vst classic analog compressors like pultec well vst optical compressors only mention these way saying am very familiar compressors adept at using them pretty thorough understanding compression ratios attack release points learned use them sparringly care behringer cs400 does good job straight compressor usefull taming levels from your boosting your signal which adds punch signal presented your other effects ultimately your amp recording circles often hear good engineers say if they can hear compressor working being used correctly behringer cs400 quiet almost transparent unlike behringer dc9 discuss below yes plastic fairly well made unless really rough equipment little care should last few years if putting into pedal board should last long time if money concern go ahead spend more rugged pedal made metal expect pay somewhere around up keeley mxr digitech etc unless go over don think there will be difference performance even then will be subtle if your signal path aready has hum static pedal will change actually may increase because what compressors do lower high signals bring up lower signals more uniform sound if want just smooth out your peaks tighten up your sound more punch little behringer cs400 will do behringer also makes another compressor pedal same price range behringer dc9 all metal attempts clone classic mxr pedal personally would stay away from pedal live use bought one found although gives great sustain also colors your tone seems attenuate your low end quite bit higher compession ratios need long sustain can dial more low end your amp if expect turn compressor off different songs will hear tone difference don use dc9 when play live like when record using vox vt30 amp like better than built compressor vt30 play nights week midi assisted duo our pa pair mackie thumps powered floor behringer b212d powered stands mackie board we adjust pa room by adding or reducing number powered speakers larger rooms we regular pair floor monitors smaller rooms where stuck corner between coat rack waiters station know spot where they generously removed two small tables we don space floor monitors these smaller jobs become much more common needed compact yet powerful monitor since we work midi sound modules reproduce drums bass assorted extra instuments very important we hear these sounds clearly behringer monitors do job well overall sound clean clear speakers light portable me boom stand adapter works well compared behringers their clone mackie srm frankly couldn hear major difference mp3 player playing through them obviously behringer cloned mackie did good job they all same inputs outputs mackie look almost exactly same owned pair behringer b21d powered speakers about three years now they been knocked over mistreated accidentally still work great every night so am fan behringer gear end real difference was price behringer go while mackie go about choice was simple since couldn hear or see major difference bought behringer only had them about two months been pleased so far update has been couple months more since started using these monitors even purchased an additional one still love sound all other things posted above forget about boom stand adapter very difficult get lined up so mic facing because angle monitor itself which adjustable boom will stay place am using good quality telescoping mini boom very big or heavy at all will stay up save yourself headaches just carry another mic stand other than these great monitors
544	 these strings very bright full they sound great couple weeks then get bit dead haven had any problems breakage just loss tone over time seems faster than some other strings ve tried sturdy stand works equally well electric or acoustic guitars stands well padded where they will touch while back support wouldn scratch anyway nice lines up perfectly strat scratch plate these stands lot sturdier than would think by picture mainly because sits very low low center gravity makes less likely tip when knocked at little more an angle than am used other stands overall excellent ve replaced all stands these excellent strings they last long time sound great pretty cheap good strings they work sound good didn notice much difference between these run mill d addario strings works well easily keeps guitars humidified less maintenance than other humidifiers ve had don use other features tuner product spot filters out noise well when using mic only two things gripe leg can use prop up isn very usable great gig use screen isn readable home tuner or brightly lit gig excellent dr duck ax wax works great all guitars including nitro finished ones can be hard remove if use too much so apply only few drops at time
545	 ive been trying different strings years ive been stuck elixirs some time now wanted change these very bright clean very playable im huge fan elixir however first go polyweb there no disappointment here ok so they just screws quality replacement ones rusting one fender licensed there was nothing wrong original neckplate was replacing rest hardwear pick up just add just little something extra was direct replacement original arm direct replacement original bit long liking may shorten down near future think set five bit overkill since only needed three these direct replacement originals player recently march started play uke bought these strings replace set came instrument these string play good stay tune pretty well will buy again very nice super vivid easy see color clamp portion seems be sturdy well built great buy money works great easy use also seems be very accurate definitely worth money should also work any stringed instrument price lil guy does job got add pedal board seems do good job boosting mids highs seem get lost pedals cables pedal somewhat cheaply made jacks don really seem fit housing so well do somewhat semi permanently fixed board so do think will be an issue
546	 tried different brands weights strings search ones would give clear bright yet robust sound found martin msp sp strings knew had found strings after short time playing these they light fingers sound great priced right like these even better than martin custom lights they give off such warm tone holding up very well only thing would been nicer bumped rating up would be send felt pad button used rubber washer had worked very well was easy install while sound improvement huge didn need be when comes music little extra makes difference planet waves o ports gives me extra no doubt will continue please me many many years come
547	 martin makes variety good sounding strings these toward light end sound bright lacks fullness found some heavier strings such asmartin msp4150 sp phosphor bronze acoustic strings light medium custom light easier play bright tone them can make sound like cheaper model compared light medium some disadvantages thinner strings they can limit your dynamics if strum harder they more stretchy tuning will be less consistent changing tone same reason bend would if play at fairly consistent sound level can expect more bright sound than resonant one other hand compared some other brands more dampened sound brightness can make an instrument sound quite good depending your style these might be good choice if used playing solid body electric lighter feel strings make medium strings uncomfortable these might seem more at home if used martin medium strings want something can play few extra hours day without feeling if overdoing things might like these too when pick up martin medium strings may find even cheaper sounds better comparison these more upscale one wouldn say dislike these wouldn quite say those who gave five stars oversold them because they may deserve five stars your particular needs an all around choice there better sounding ones from martin moot point if don feel comfortable playing them make sure read variety reviews before deciding because there other equally valid viewpoints just each player unique by definition medium an between size when comes strings most range goes from extra light medium scale these strings would be above literal medium me an everyday instrument don typically spend five hours day one sometimes go weeks without picking one up do periods where will spend many hours day playing don want something will kill me medium string sense word too much me light custom light easier play can make higher end martin sound like one closer bottom line me these light medium exactly where want strings be if like martin medium find them bit much at times find give up too much when play much lighter ones may find these great choice don feel am missing anything compared medium if had two identical guitars new strings each type would probably find differences side by side comparison without don think d notice difference normal listening lighter varieties would be far from true if martin extra light light were skim milk milk strings these light medium would be came along people who wanted something lighter still came close whole milk taste pegs been giving me difficulty while been temperamental subject slipping long can remember d guess they about years wear them used be able deal violin teachers techs knew never suggested pegs were problem more recently tried adding fine tuners g d make easier tune resultant shortening strings affected sound too much figured d give drops try change was immediate was able work pegs more easily slippage went away immediately decided give hours before changing strings when did also removed three fine tuners still had control needed after changing one string things worked well then had peg slip suddenly figured d try retuning perhaps was fault ended up slipping loose again tried reapplying peg drops seemed fix problem after had no more slippage now one peg binding instructions clear minimal open ended don expect them tell exactly how often use drops they could given bit more info what expect what symptoms indicate so forth tried contacting manufacturer few brief questions never heard back suffice say drops made an incredible difference did provide me foolproof instant cure d definitely recommend them hope get some comments from users more experience so can better idea what makes people know time reapply what they experience when they do advantage good peg control can get high quality gut or synthetic metal core strings be able tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners effort had without drops made me avoid playing was using yamaha sv most time can be fun didn realize how much missed richness an old acoustic violin stayed tune don experience toy instruments lots experience better quality ones including professional semi professional ones m ukulele player one daughter whose high school ukulele club features players variety instruments me compare one found one be made well enough plays well frets properly aligned instrument stays tune notes played alternate frets tune well would expect relative each other tuning issues others mentioned relative break periods no different from what would expect violins or guitars perfectly normal although plays well was disappointed workmanship since did see similar comments from others perhaps mine representative workmanship somewhere closer level lower quality instruments ve seen other types finishing quality out line price range does approach what other reviewers led me believe wood properly finished where neck meets body there clear sanding marks wrong direction looks if had been finished hurry by somebody who had no intention doing quality job less important issue has do grain normally instrument makers will try line up grain direction body mine grain at slant giving impression neck slightly bent an optical illusion sign higher quality instrument making workmanship issues cosmetic m still quite satisfied way instrument plays finishing issues will be visible when being played tonal quality about what d expect from an instrument such small resonating chamber perhaps there better sounding soprano models out there at price point what expect if disappointed want something better expect pay at least double bag was nicer than expected price considering many soprano ukuleles t0 range lot people won want buy hard case three times price gig bag or more money than their instrument cost case better padded than might expected price since soprano ukuleles small lightweight instruments clear me why hard case would be important most people might be somebody evaluating cases or cases other larger instruments if small child who likely sit instrument or drop down stairs constantly might want consider something better should provide

ways tune ranging from using tuning fork sitting next properly tuned piano ve also used variety electronic tuners over years everything from rows flashing lights meters needle there some excellent tuners out there tone generators metronomes etc built device simple portable easy use just plain works also cheap enough even if other types tuners worth money get one these each case aside from its simplicity also less bothered by background noise other units microphones might be

people thought they were so great duh while people may disagree how say name few debate idea these great strings less expensive most string sets out there especially if buy multi packs color coded make string changes easy easy find from most any vendor or music store made usa can collect players points swag they sealed special environmentally friendly package keep them fresh corrosion free they one widest range string size combinations availableif just starting out do know what put your new then phrase set up exl 120s or put some da dairy o nines good choice at least strat or tele like personally like them better than ernie ball super slinkys aka eb pinks cannot quite put finger why can pay more coated strings cryogenic frozen strings boutique strings all if do know what any those then probably haven been playing long enough find value them almost every guitarist has set strings they swear by because they work wonders no other string can they make them play smoother or faster their last set strings lasted years or whatever just appreciate great value d addario strings just btw record official pronunciation da dairy o we receive letters each week regarding correct pronunciation d addario name some years back we even ran an ad illustrated an easy way pronounce d addario name name pronounced phonetically follows da dairy o simple way pronounce most difficult name musical accessories just had setup dr pure blues they sound pretty good they bit stiff ve also noticed bit what must presume nickel coating seems come off fingertips after practicing an hour or so almost looks like graphite fingers nowhere near black oxidation ve seen from low quality strings they also seem more string squeak when changing chords than other brands even after generously spritzing them withfingerease string lubricanti am qualified say if they truly give vintage tone they do sound decent however would rather getdean markley blue steel lt electric strings or save some money go withd addario exl120 electric strings super light evenernie ball super slinky string set seem feel better me am da dairy o man now seagull entourage rustic fits very snug think good thing certain case which has nice faux fur lining seems well made was considering theseagull dreadnought casebut there were no useful pictures or details item decided try guardian save few bucks seems like made good choice black tortex picks silver lettering jazz picks about smaller than standard tortex picks more pronounced point ve tried pretty much every harp out there after having played regional blues jazz circuit about years lee oskar harps best value top lee oskar actually called me once just because left question his website ve met rick epping hohner harmonicas at namm great guy he never called me at afternoon just because could identify song thought he was playing carry around between or harps gig so at least set lee oksar harps suzuki manji harps while nice phosphor bronze reeds great would cost nearly presuming could find them will say ve never blown reed lo will say new set lo reed plates beats new manji at least book top all they really did manji discontinue bushman delta frost harmonicas rename them so they could double price lee oskar harmonicas inexpensive they simple cheap repair easy play great tone even easy identify since 1st 2nd position keys printed right comb feature great beginners who might be able keep them straight yet give them shot bought intending use seagull acoustic tonight put squier fat strat instead after getting tired how raw existing polypropylene strap which was about same price just because had fender embroidered was making neck when put electric difference was immediately noticable even though neck was still sore from cheap strap so decided sign write review strap softer better made than poly ones even comes string tie your acoustic which might need consider taking advice treat yourself strap when guitars cost hundreds if thousands dollars much besides cotton suede will scratch your axe only downside strap ends pretty thick very snug pegs use c type snap strap locks they will no longer fit maybe ll see if venerable grolsch strap locks will work can spend more get wider straps more padding if want do bother getting something cheaper unless strap at least quality sale update too snug grolsch strap locks squier

maintenance stationthat had some pretty good reviews well cannot speak dunlop can say kit light weight self contained has storage space works if face up or face down also has pad keep your from sliding pad keeps neck rest place so does topple over do see anything like mentioned dunlop nc65 top think neck rest pad inguitar setup maintenance instructional dvd denny rauenis one turned over so fender logo showing nicely made good value seems be bit stiff right now single strip leather no padding maybe just needs be broken compliments color lake placid blue strat well record strap actually quite long even second strap hole am about trim lbs at shortest setting can manage strap too long keep heastock up effectively when am sitting update jul strap still rather stiff will probably pick up white cotton strap those fit well can be resized lot more efficiently opinion
563	 ve been huge fan dunlop picks long time started playing years ago used slim floppy picks long time time went skills grew needed pick was sturdy wouldn flex play more intricate detailed songs tortex purples favorite they re thickest ones can find like soft sandy feel these they don slip out your hand easily because they re so thick they take long time wear out buy elixirs all acoustic guitars now they last longest hold brightest clearest tone any string ve ever used nanoweb coating really does make huge difference they take several months wear out opposed weeks other major brands last they may cost bit more than competition if try them love them much do ll never use anything else again own ataylor guitars ce jumbo string acoustic electric guitarand came these strings string guitars generally hard play long periods time so they might get much use regular string tone from these strings just bright clear months later they still hold their tuning like they after first days elixir strings general more expensive than other major brands extra few bucks worth because sounds stays so clear consistent after extensive use they great strings any ve been eyeing these stands while always seemed like such lot money something just hold upright d spent little money usually here there cheapy little stands spinning base now finally one these m throwing those pieces junk out buying few more these hercules stands hold acoustic electric guitars very well extendable neck can also handle bass angle leans back makes very stable when hanging center gravity such takes quite bit force tip stand over holds both electric acoustics haven done any full drop tests regardless which put stand didn once feel like was going tip over easily or drop piece mind key an instrument costs several thousand dollars stand lives up expectations does exactly what meant do own several taylor acoustics few other kinds guitars bought original pack these from suggestion friend who had few acoustics damaged by humidity too dry these so easy use can be recharged if feel like too much every couple months ve successfully recharged these using distilled water about times now they work just great they did new these also come resealable package so can recharge them then store them until need replace other set case can tell when they ve dried out by fact they get crunchy feeling means they need be replaced recharge them take large ziplock plastic container lid big enough hold quart then pour few cups distilled water bottom next take smaller empty ziplock container bottom one big enough hold sandwich float water larger container then place packs floating container stacked one another or their sides seal top larger container lid traps humidity container membrane these packs two way so they absorb until they reach capacity again bought complement 414ce ltd fall wanted something would last long time provide nice suede feel keep strap from sliding around shoulder took little bit get hole over butt peg almost seemed slit they cut was too small after working at few minutes got fit wore really nicely once got length where wanted taking off isn too much trouble over past few months bottom slit has stretched little more enough make easier get m glad came little tighter initially leather stretches over time clear they had mind when they make these quality excellent m buying another one go string taylor wanted find device let me record easily when at gig or just office did lot research into devices were usb only even other ones focusrite sold main reason picked one was its versatility being both ipad usb compatible complaints about ipad connector cable valid too stiff short feel like might accidently break off if m too careful why uses proprietary connector back unit ll never know combat included pin cable bought 3ft pin extension cable which seems do job nicely garageband software ipad simple enough use while can only record one input channels at time fine what expected record from live sound board just use xlr input set gain awesome colored halo ring save recording mono track being small solidly built ve got no problem tossing milk crate rest cables peddles regards how records when plugging into computer via usb an imac case even better than expected garageband software mac does ability record both input channels at time time board monitor volume headphone fantastic thought only would play back what was being input at moment does more than real monitor garageband software recognizes monitor output when multi track recording re working software allows pass back other tracks from computer while recording new track example recorded track just track was using input channel laid down track then created second track recorded second part headphones plugged into itrack solo was able hear both current track was recording first track lastly plugged mic into first input created 3rd vocal only track when was singing was able hear both parts headphones still plugged into itrack solo well vocals recording real time wasn expecting level capability was very impressed by lack any noticeable latency both backing tracks vocals was recording all going at same time last thing want mention xlr pre amp focusrite has been making high end professional recording equipment long time thing they re most well known mic pre amp say spectacular there absolutely no noise no hiss or clicks any kind gain nobs color halos make so easy setup almost too easy sound captures exactly what expect ll notice right away if re using low quality microphone definitely stands up their reputation having 48v phantom power use those top dollar condenser mics also really nice thing demos their website show how simple use once start playing ll realize really nice tool solo artist or someone who wants high portability great sound quality

style playing they seem more durable than other brands they re inexpensive since play lot hours always keep lots these hand love em use them daily rely them just finished installing these couldn be any happier product sturdily built product everything need installation didn think was possible actually found product made usa will definitely buy more these collection grows did mis matching color

variables combine make strings your very own personal favorite me these strings bring all together string choice all acoustic electrics use play what consider rock ballads using strumming style play love feel tone these strings style play equipment set up do some issues these strings overall m willing put up issues overall performance get from ej26 strings issues include what think may be premature breakage do play hard play long playing several hours daily play rock ballads using somewhat softer strumming style definitely do pound strings like think fairly gentle strumming yet seem manage break high e b strings regular basis by playing by over tuning some can be expected what bothers me frequency which m breaking g strings simply don think these wound g should be breaking at all style playing ve noticed current most helpful critical review mentions same problem change strings frequently so don think reason they breaking overall am willing put up what believe be some premature breakage especially g string other qualities draw me ej26 strings they sound great style play equipment set up they feel great love em will continue buy quantities them acoustic electrics just wish had better feeling about premature breakage how much can say about little piece rubber sticks your mic stand first great price about same big mac lol second fits great does exactly what supposed do third now use pick holder wonder why never did so before do tendency break drop or even wear out picks when playing handy little device reduces imnpact tendency some solid heavier weighted stands stand up quick grab pick from holder when using one cheaper lighter tripod style stands make sure m careful lightly or barely insert picks into holder so don pull whole stand down when extracting pick great product couldn live without lol manufacturer fault some cheap light weight stands if re looking pick holder can think any reason try one works great keeps all fretboards looking great even though change strings frequently twelve acoustic electric guitars bottle will last forever play hard several hours almost every day m always amazed at crud accumulates fretboards guess ll stop eating cheetos while m playing just kidding oil breaks down crud restores look fretboard new condition no issues no problems only positive things say about oil musicians sometimes we find just right sound or feel piece equipment changes everything taking our performance new level me happened when found just right sound feel from taylor acoustic right vocal mics right mixer bose l1 model ii etc today had one those finds after years being somewhat dissatisfied every capo ve encountered discovered perfect capo me g7th performance capo m kidding was one those finds an acoustic player vocalist obviously play all songs right key an optimum vocal performance means occasionally relying capo get just right key just right chord shape structure unfortunately some songs had weak spots sending them b list courtesy combination weaker chord me due physical limitations reduced sustain tonal quality resulting from using capo dissatisfaction has had me capo quest which ended today when found g7th performance capo first thing noticed when used g7th was improved sustain over every other capo ve used all those weak spots songs totally disappeared quickly dusted off several songs were b list found improved sustain tonal quality allowed me move them list no problem weight capo others pointed out heavier can detect any change balance when handling play sitting stool resting leg perhaps someone standing using strap might notice slight difference balance love self ratcheting feature g7th thought from some reviews videos watched d pinch down open end fairly firmly secure hold was case think g7th has just right width density foam under top bar providing more friction hold capo place b playing role very effectively dampening strings c possibly being more gentle strings than more narrow harder foam or rubber top bar thus having less impact tuning did find one slight negative about capo which was able quickly overcome end top metal bar open end capo slightly more squared off than end bottom piece which contrast rounded off may be just way play some chords hand was contacting squared off end top bar was getting irritated so simply turned capo around open end facing me versus facing floor surfaces contacting hand were far smoother thus zero irritation was nothing new me had do other capos others commented cost capo me cost capo was nothing compared many thousands dollars ve spent finding just right guitars pa mics other equipment accessories almost can believe only cost me make such difference sound g7th performance capo priceless overall highly recommend capo if re like me could be very inexpensive way take your performance next level m strong believer having back ups critical components so will immediately purchase another g7th back up maybe ll order black or gold use silver one back up been using little amp very heavily about year now highly recommend device extremely compact taking up virtually no space sitting right next mixer does exactly what expect sound clean works great great price meets requirements perfectly use several behringer components set up e g mixer pa speakers effects accessories etc including pedal confidence behringer name always feel like m getting good solid piece equipment can rely pedal no exception sturdily built effects pedal will give exactly what looking compressor pedal don like depend battery power any critical components if don so also purchased behringer psu sb power supply general purpose dc 9v power adaptor available amazon along great price sturdily built great compressor effect always keep lot these hand these only picks use when playing acoustic guitars strumming style vocals since play several hours nearly every day tendency go through lot picks these definitely last longer me than other brands similar

598	 use dunlop 60mm nylon picks current standard decided give lighter 38mm try unfortunately volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing an acoustic especially an outdoor picnic setting basically unusable purpose however did find these were just ticket personal practice allowing me hear metronome or backtrack far easier so although they failed original performance intention stars filling need didn even know had vast multitude players will solemnly agree we all experienced search personal holy grail picks am no exception dozens dozens makers styles shapes gages materials price ranges oh ya dollar picks name ve tried even nail picking metal strings now if new perfect pick quest must understand picks subjective scent personal grip sound interaction host music ingredients making your grail different however if play light metal string acoustic main an aria af tenor check out these dunlops nylons even within dunlop line tried different grips thickness gages after all said done these relatively cheap picks all remained standing first choice just heavy enough be heard unplugged without folding pick around thumb light enough strum fluidly without yanking at lighter strings just right material keep low strings thumping high strings singing even dunlop nylon max grip same gage didn acoustically perform quite same would try another pick if chance was presented sure most us would since quest holy grail never truly ends until then dunlop nylon without hesitation closest thing gotten pick perfection fantastic strap nope isn leather or tooled or all kind stuff really comfortable fitted ease even cc ot banjo has really tight spacing all others tried were bit work fit through brackets had heavy weight resonator bluegrass once again extremely comfortable sturdy so had buy another so can just one each just received case today soonest delivery day estimation range plus there now having spent long time pricing hard cases from all around internet price extremely reasonable wonderful case nothing fancy differs slightly from pictured item outside rim threading basic locks keys included gold toned instead silver toned pictured doesn mean diddly squat me plush interior small yet roomy compartment located under neck am primarily string banjo player decided casually play around mandolin so figured had better get hard case possible long time storage first banjo lived padded gig bag few years before started getting serious boy best thing small enclosed storage spaces case will definitely do trick excellent value additional note there bit extra play around peg head an rover mandolin can see if someone traveled case dropped hard enough some peg snapping may occur again simple storage protection its non issue bought first one from amazon over month ago simply fell love cleans polishes wood metal although strings use ghs fast fret eye glasses computer screens etc wonderful ability easily replacing casual cleaning polishing fluids even recently bought 2nd just because yes first one has finally gone through wash after month constant use knew was time when wasn wiping off smudges quickly came out slightly nappy texture be expected really still works well ever there vast amount different polish cloth brands out there won go wrong one just got stand today quickest delivery ever super savings free shipping selected ever experienced go go amazon lulz anyhoo two banjos mandolin purchased looked about quite bit at various sites reviews prices etc pretty much hercules got best reviews everywhere although admittedly hadn really wanted shell out over dollars yet tri stand really looked good solid general review am rather tight space overall think trailer home size wanted way hold instruments one place without having work around gig bags or hard cases taking up limited living space stands figuratively literally hercules tri stand does job excellently two banjos all three instruments varying heights resonator bluegrass banjo being longest naturally mandolin being shortest open back clawhammer banjo middle three back rest fold outs static attached center ring can adjust them independently little up down compensate such length difference between bluegrass banjo mandolin however mandolin really lite thing so suspect will be fine just hanging there by peg head without back rest long stand isn jostled around own case aside from two rather lazy cats pending no sudden hip smash oops by me shouldn be an issue course considering am looking at possible third banjo mandolin may just go live its case after all now word about open back banjos if considering stand first off no was going rest coordinator rod against back rest just seems like bad idea what ended up doing was adjusting back rests so resonator bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from bottom allowing open back rest other side top rest along lip banjo rim at edge rest foam where begins curve out down tail piece nut between two foam pads without touching thing seems pretty solid position while still engaging weight clamps up at top give stars mainly based excellent quality stand fact only three instrument stand worth any kind hoot been able find its absolute perfect thing own application would need three back rests be independently adjustable height overall am extremely pleased now two these really wish now had ordered more at time before slight price increase kicks self all can say simply can beat also hercules tri stand 10x more expensive than one between two gotta admit only major advantage tri stand has saving space which actually huge consideration me honestly don know why other reviewers had such hard time balance two musician gear tubular stands currently own never once given me an issue aside from bodily running into thing they held do hold variety guitars various styles banjos both open back bg resonator mandolas anything long neck all all unless there some specialized stand need would first come musician gear home practice area rather dark corner limited room clipped onto music stand illuminates music far better than previous ones had used including one used full sized bulb rather too much light very portable no trouble others mentioned just loses star because included ac adapter cord short making all intents purposes useless me without having string along an extension cord music stand ugh more cords just want reiterate however what another review mentioned thumbpicks both came medium which at time didn pay any attention however after about weeks using them fingerpicks banjo came conclusion needed large size thumb mediums sat little too high up thumbnail comfort suppose could put them hot water stretch them out read regardless quick n dirty set someone just starting out its just ticket without having buy bunch sets figure out what comfortable price assortment mind give stars been online shopping banjos quite extensively ebay amazon dozen online shops reviews from multitude sources investigating manufacturer home sites etc did same banjo although there actually very little out there about particular banjo still felt very comfortable what little put together information wise frankly at price gets warmest recommendation those tight budget sometimes just can afford dollars mainstream name beginner brand additionally mine came very well setup from seller aside from inevitable tuning its purty too would also deeply recommendsnark sn all instrument clip chromatic tuner absolutely best tuner ever used makes various banjo tuning schemes breeze be aware order avoid possible confusion jameson guitars actually sub brand davison guitars so if order look at your peg head says davison like mine does r w jameson its same maker yes examined davison home site well amazon seller mother plays am banjo mandolin player snark sn came mail while was gone days she opened up got curious tried out her prolly hasn been tune since dunno she loved lulz little thing really absolute favorite instrument accessory both vibrational an internal mic pickup was using old korg chromatic those times wanted see if was singing correct note was actually pleasantly surprised snark sn had mic one less accessory little bag now di am slightly ambivalent about silent metronome function however its neat can play without tick tock distraction still look up once awhile see if beat an actual instructional tool keeping tempo mmm would still highly recommend using an audible metronome side note if friends family play string instrument be aware your

622	 how pick feels such matter individual preference there really doesn seem be much point trying rate them what like about particular type pick may be relevant another player most picks high ratings because players who like particular type write reviews rate them highly obviously best thing do playing pick your own isn always possible said what they worth here thoughts regarding jim dunlop purple colored big stubby 0mm picks like pick sharp point better control big stubby certainly meets criteria sharp point pick rounded edges help stubby slide smoothly off individual strings which makes easier picking besides electric find these picks nicely suited acoustic semi solid body guitars where string tension greater had tried 0mm stubby previously 0mm pick much thicker heavier has absolutely no give at all m still getting used playing something stiff hard although pick has rounded depressions each side fingers when picking rapidly find maintaining grip can still be little tricky keeping pick clean dry does help favorite pick had been thedunlop 6mm nylon pick am very pleased performance feel 0mm stubby can locate strings easily be more precise while still being able play decent speed time will tell may become new favorite pick pick pack contains picks only paid which simply an outstanding deal if re player looking really stiff almost indestructible pick might want give ultra heavy duty stubby try designed accommodate most standard shaped picks dunlop pick holder handy little spring loaded device storing picks can mix brands types how many picks can fit inside will vary from around three perhaps dozen guide about dunlop 60mm nylon picks will fit only dunlop 50mm delrin picks even thick irregular picks like dunlop big stubby will fit however total number will be greatly reduced build quality good forcing too many picks inside could cause spring fail or seam split piece double stick tape shaped match pick holder included tape does barely passable job hold device place stuck mine backside headstock while stays place pretty wobbly color options at time seem be limited black if diy skills could paint whatever color like decent buy below two dollar level prefer model over thedunlop pick holder because seems be sturdier like more rounded appearance pro tec manufactures variety accessories musical instruments their low cost black nylon strap well constructed high quality item top seller at amazon large sized attachment tabs quite thick about inch although fit typical strap nuts snug some type strap retainer would still be recommended black works most colors strap should last long time so inexpensive if qualify free shipping might want consider ordering spare most better quality leather straps typically or more so retrospect low cost planet waves black leather strap should served red flag bought anyway hoping would be decent product unfortunately upon receiving was almost immediately disappointed at quality item while strap appears be leather isn piece junk doesn appear be very high quality leather thin soft would be at all surprised if edges soon begin curl strap begins wrinkle don expect leather around holes strap nuts hold up well long term if use strap probably want use some kind strap locking system leather straps lasted over ten years leather thicker stiffer has resisted fraying along edges while leather has developed some cracks still holding up fine there no chance strap will tear could be wrong looking at planet waves strap doubts will hold up anywhere near well or long if casual player strap probably fine although strap locks recommended leather may start curl up deform strap certainly isn going fail immediately while serviceable more serious players or those an aggressive style playing might want spending little more better quality leather strap decided keep strap installed secondary don play much normally use dunlop 60mm nylon picks decided give 60mm max grips try when price dropped dozen top half max grips special surface tiny ridges gently bite into skin provide nice secure grip feeling little strange at first should get used quickly like feel playability 60mm max grip they little more flexible than prefer so if were get another set would get thicker type 73mmor0 88mm love snark sn5 tuner works smoothly without any issues allows me tune swiftly

632	 just let people know off bat can tell these picks small if used big picks these might turn off while trust me when say once get used these picks start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly never thought would say pick helped me improve playing does now when try any bigger pick even use those picks more skill now because these picks trust me if put up these picks while get used them will improve or at least many other people agree d title says all may take while getting use these smaller picks long run will e happy tried these picks also since these picks smaller found was easy do pinch harmonics these compared bigger picks so if having hard time pinch harmonics try these out use use hands turn tuning pegs let me tell takes forever take off strings put them also wire cutter getting messed up from cutting strings now can change strings faster dont look wire cutter all time its small can fit pouch case also people who new dont use tune its put strings be careful over tune because will break strings hands will always be best when do precise tuning just get tuning ball park then using your hands these strings great price they sound nice pretty long lasting dont last or sound nice higher end strings who cares when strings affordable these strings great people starting because its cheaper its big deal when break lot strings these great cables gave four because after playing cheap rotosound cables learned they just good only bucks still great cable these sound slightly better than rotosound thats if super observant because their isnt much difference these great people when practicing they cheap sound good they almost good sounding monster cables just little bit worse actually dont use monster cables anymore like one more price how can complain tip people new cable angled jack best when sit play because when plug straight one into jack sit actually bend wire what happens wire actually be bent certain way work eventually wont work at all just like headphone wires when plugged angled one into its all good no problems
633	 last forever easy hold onto much more say there really isnt much more needs be said favorite picks its ok does what says if youre using more than one other pedal get loud white noise background quick accurate also like use bypass mode standby switch changing guitars doesnt register notes well both pickups engaged though payed just because tuner was so slow respond needed something new response time like half second super simple use keep mind snark website sells tuner so cost here definitely worth
634	 nice tone very easy grip last me long time one favorite picks ve tried electric don enjoy them much acoustic was first acoustic ve received some surprised looks about its tone play ability both from from luthier who used be tech at martin couple pro players years respectively under their belts light comfortable well made has fast neck just marvelous every way beginner like myself wonderfully priced was expecting be disappointed didn want invest new hobby until was sure d stick possible just lucked out good one after year playing jasmine no urge upgrade anything else will confess d like string another animal am too new inexperienced acoustics be able really define sonic quality compared more expensive models m more an electric guy me ignorant state stars without hesitation did need set up however stock strings mine were poor condition don recall if purchased amazon any event trip luthier new strings felt like far excess has stayed tune quite nicely often change tunings standard mostly eb occasional full step down open d g others no fret buzz just love feel neck do wish body was tad thinner shoulder problems m sure thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass richness nice light however perfect carrying your back by way model black pickguard one pictured looks similar every other way quite sure same model ve never had problem these patch cables m running pedals no issues like crackling or cutting out one thing important note m hard gear m home noodler so can say if these patches can take road stage abuse lots setup tear down cycles they seem pretty buff capable can only report what ve experienced these must item heretofore ve been using planet waves strap straplock mechanism while an innovative system doesn require any installation plastic ends large bit awkward can get way things installed schallers warmoth strat body found needed add some toothpick pieces per recommendations others achieve super tight fit big deal at all these schallers exactly what wanted stars no brainer while wish bases came different colors really like these hangars they look good perform well hang strats them experienced any problems think saw video youtube said strat headstocks could slip easy install hanging releasing no brainer three these hercules hangers didn purchase pedal from amazon wanted write review wasn expecting much from pedal quite good completely authentic acoustic sound d say exactly kind close far cry from lowering your volume raising your master which still sounds distinctly electric so far setting most convincing acoustic tones would be jumbo setting again don expect sound completely acoustic nice way at least approach sound check out some youtube tests before buying okay blues jr nos really shines crate td which brighter amp less colored zero spring verb use pedal onboard reverb best results used strat also humbuckered duncan hotrod set sounds good both guitars especially neck center positions pedal solid be advised comes volt from factory so if use dc power source then ll want remove battery do so ll see black knob at base pedal just unscrew pop hood remove battery overally solid pedal d expect from boss word warning sure if setup when ac effects chain loop front blues jr started getting really bad static sounds sounded like amp was malfunctioning burnt tube or like when run alone crate haven experienced could be any number things effects chain so check if others experience m wondering if small cheap acoustic amp would help augment acoustic tone pedal never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp sure how non piezo pickup would affect tone anyone know about good grippy picks some types playing go back forth between these jazz iiis when m jazz pick kind mood e when m using ginormous gypsy jazz picks or fender heavies especially dig davas all models acoustic playing strumming nice tone well tried pretty much every dava each has its pluses specific kinds playing one thing about davas once while pick will slightly move grip ll pick string rubber hand angle can also play part probably just me using line from amp single pedal works great no noise well made cable bullet proof molded ts protection cable slightly thin side functions well without doubt very sturdy cable some neurological problems picking hand can seem hold onto picks really like these max grips lot found they excellent soloing great tone well tastes they bit stiff strumming perfect everything else love size wouldn want anything larger advantage these over dava jazz picks if they do move about your grip can still pick them davas rubber coating over grip part can only be used sharp side would say davas slightly more flexible literally figuratively use dava jazz more rhythm oriented playing cannot recall how these picks acoustic ve been an electric fixation lately also fan regular jazz iiis find they don slip much dunlop tortex picks think due both materials pick raised lettering still terms grip they don hold candle max grips both picks their own unique tonal character ve tried variety picks think once get used smaller picks will find larger styles feel clumsy awkward these jazz picks also great pinch harmonics they just bit difficult adjust hand fly because they so grippy overall these picks choice style which blues oriented surprised there so few reviews edit strumming issue can be overcome playing around pick angle getting easier these also since found while these fantastic picks actually prefer thedunlop jazz iii pick pack red nylon 38mmdespite lack max grip raised lettering they just most wonderful picks ve used do plan try out some 2mm picks however suspect m going prefer thicker pick iii nylons feels slightly thicker than max grips which believe why prefer them although didn purchase snark sn amazon wanted share excellent customer service experience about company clearly cares about its customers had problem snark company displayed first class customer service exceeding expectations sn must far m concerned had been using iphone until friend recommended snark tuner so much easier use like logical incremental led display shows if re flat or sharp iphone app ve been using doesn always display frequency when m really out tune so no visual indicator where tuning at if had better ear no problem such case snark only shows bar display also displays notes your string playing much easier don need select your tuning or anything first picks up your frequency whatever string re simply dial great sturdy clip well thought out foot pad works perfectly acoustic electric usually just leave snark music stand where can use visual metronome can also just clip nearby desk buy confidence ll love edit although still love little tuner model has suffered few issues which will address here m certain if design flaw or little plastic pieces serve socket joint both ends adjustable ball arm tendency snap off think manufacturer should look into perhaps design single ring plastic which may more integrity also rubber feet fell off long ago very moderate use at home electronics themselves held up admirably no matter how many times hard reset 3gs no success there no problem jack phone pristine condition no problems until now there definitely connection communication because mic sample track work about registered amplitude app followed all instructions box tested irig an iphone was able get operating am giving two stars because did work friend iphone purposes 3gs brick if anyone has any suggestions lead successful operation will re rate product another excellent gadget from planet waves what great idea already has made life easier keep pile jazz iiis concave pocket shallow depression holding stuff don own any very expensive guitars so m concerned about resting their bodies carpet rest simply makes your more accessible means re more apt grab your axe play more when un weighted by neck rest itself rather light can move around easily no big deal at all edit just purchased another one an axe close at hand an axe will play been experience after living few days one thing has become an annoyance when there no holding table very easy knock off desk way designed such leverage has see saw effect will fly few feet across room because sticks out horizontally just nudge knee there goes so if picks or anything sitting round holder area can be an annoyance do use these guitars feel much more comfortable using proper stand product worthwhile quick location setting down your axe without searching stand if product had way either using suction or tab secure itself surface would earn another star

671	 used 5string bass liked how helps me slide around fretboard easier friend tried her acoustic hated her reason her opinion simple stuff puts out lot more oil or whatever than would think has unintended consequence oil making your hard earned callouses soft which when playing can lead bleeding fingers pretty fast did friend apply simply hold handle press down while running along each string one string at time highly suggest only use one slide down each string at first may look like anything getting your strings give few minutes will start see excess oil appear start pooling under strings your fretboard ok will need wipe away excess m telling if accidentally get too much excess oil may come off easily didn me at least mine left little pools oil between frets only used one swipe thought had just little there naturally product also makes your fingers very oily feeling friend hated part too agree her soft callouses no callouses good product idea like theory thick bass strings didn severe problem w soft fingertips she did just be aware possibility being problem does what says may like what else does or how feels your fingers simple product easy use works exactly supposed without costing too much got one banjo ubass mandolin course can use anything really did expect much from rag just wanted good quality lint free scratch free cloth clean stringed instruments before after each use was totally surprised actually works good removes all crap your shiny finish without having spend time constantly cleaning cleaner will probably help protect your finish over long run too may wonder how can get excited just over cheap little cleaning rag thing rocks picks up every smudge smear print leaves nothing behind an amazing little cleaning tool will replace if when ever wears out if like me want your instruments look clean grunge free onstage should check out little wonder can just keep your pocket wipe once between songs if want doesn get any easier great product note about mixed reviews really wish amazon would separate different cloths instead lumping them into one product page really isn fair actual good product rating artificially lowered by bad reviews completely different item also causes confusion potential buyers because they sift through every review find ones apply actual product they want when go product page amazingly good micro fiber cloth see horrible reviews about fraying lint makes me sad had both other items micro fiber cloth nothing like other item has sewn seamed edges will fray never leave lint behind removes fingerprints smudges leaves only nice clean instrument behind no scratches no lint no hint was ever there always looks brand new after using cloth use thing almost every day got rant bc came here replace mine after giving away friend who fell love told him would just get another then came here couldn remember which version bought negative reviews seemed be talking about completely different item leaves behind lint what crap they talking about turns out they talking about completely different item looked up purchase history found had bought micro fiber then placed an order more me give away again putting single item type page having selectors size or color fine course putting an apple lemon same page literally lumping bad reviews horrible product great reviews wonderful product just an error needs be fixed at least now if managed find lone clarifying review hidden among dozens other mismatched ones know what version buy which avoid anyway end rant they sound great they helped revive an old acoustic had been buried closet years along very thorough cleaning don any opinion feel these strings like some reviewers honestly didn notice anything different bought them because wanted great strings an old cheap order get best sound possible these strings did just fine now sounds great job completed bought glaesel bridge glaesel rubber mute together bought because was cheap had so many good reviews mute fits bridge fine compared brass mute which course works very well mute seems do absolutely nothing there almost no discernible difference playing violin or without mute also mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises if want or need mute practicing quietly many us do suggest buy something else item does work total waste money tried mute regular acoustic violin well new electric violin bought here amazon fyi cheap little electric violin an awesome fun item just make sure buythe original peg drops by ardsley aglaesel self adjusting violin bridge mediumwith consider mute completely useless since does do anything at all does mute or lower volume any violin any noticeable way if like me truly value your usually expensive prized instruments then want make sure nothing happens them accidentally or otherwise hercules stands much much more stable than all rest they better base design even when stand inevitably gets bumped there no wobbling no worries just make sure lower all way designed be these things awesome also everything fits so perfectly hercules stands all other tri stands lean your instruments toward top too much cause headstocks bang together here plenty room everything now stand double version which also own lets your gear hang down perfectly straight protects all those very thickly padded stops see near base picture also hanging gravity grasp around neck so sweet all other stands am always worried will slide off or if gets bumped could fall out mechanism holds tight until want releases very easily naturally will let go while just sitting there check these things out will be disappointed also durability used abused hercules stand years tossing around car play at different places been tossed dropped setup stowed many times still looks works just like did when first bought doesn even any obvious visible scratches came bag discarded never used meanwhile had gone thru dozens regular cheapo stands over years before bought herc will only every buy herc stands from now these drops just convenience opinion they neccessity beginning violinists if reading wondering if should consider buying product stop your tuning pegs from slipping or make them turn smoother less dramatic tuning jumps answer yes buy does work works very well even though instructions said put drop two different places each peg wanted go light just case so at first only put drop each peg didn know what expect can always put more too much could be bad thing also each instrument different each peg different had one very stubborn peg while others were just normal level obnoxious about slipping may only need drop some pegs reccomended drops others had new strings which course going take forever stretch out will need constant tuning did remove strings just loosened pegs little pulled them out tiny bit one at time then put first drop spot where peg would make contact when put back tuning head side peg part actually turn put 2nd small drop dead end peg end turn be careful when applying don get more than small drop at time stuff spreads out over time tiny drop goes long way one bottle should last very long time what expect one drop effect immediate will notice pegs turn smoother hold their position much better after playing awhile decided put 2nd drop each peg suggested by included instruction sheet helped them all stay place even better than before pegs now also turn smoother easier can tune much easier than before smaller more accurate adjustments strings actually hold tuning much longer than before great product buy use be happy love wall hanging mount course should use longer screws than what they give should make sure mount stud or use drywall backing screws etc just common sense actual product works perfectly exactly described arms adjustable stay where put them fits 5string fender jazz bass well acoustic violin even holds neck without touching pegs if want will be buying more these other stringed instruments very well designed product works just like want hands down best tuner ve ever owned snark sn8 works extremely well being chromatic works every stringed instrument own bass banjo violin no matter what key instrument tuned still use korg pitchblack inline bass also very nice product mainly get more cord length across stage still keep signal strong little baby amazingly easy use always accurate has nice bright easy read display any lighting situation makes tuning breeze hassle just should be ve personally always hated those boss pedal tuners simply does its job does very well also buying item from amazon saved me quite bit over local center which always big plus feels tough too thing feels like can easily handle rigors being tossed around which very good thing despite flimsy way seller packaged shipping product arrived intact fast would cropped star damaged product little wimpy envelope they sent fortunately mine arrived perfect condition no thanks paper envelope seriously they should use stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something could be happier at least until buy another one keep at house while first stays gig bag

709	 fantastic just love little amp at first thought was broken batteries were sitting right very happy ok some folk don like these because sometimes they come off when knocked like them few them they don squeeze strings tight importantly they look cool disappointing was looking receiving these mostly they unplayable leak air badly easier learning bagpipes than these things save your money get some harps actually work decent case though usual an excellent zoom product adds playing just love thing too difficult get hang even me
710	 didn know little battery powered amp could sound so good sounds just good if better than roland cube course without effects such still great little amp practice little gig family friends puts out pretty good power little 5w has great sound opinion its little unstable at times fasteners adjustment areas stand do keep stand place such can be good sound studio or classroom setting sure if would recommend professional use why spend more better quality right like product wish had wider foot or base carpeted areas does get little unstable carpet does fine hard floors good medium picks decent feel sound would recommend practice picks pretty decent noodling girlfriend likes colors hahaha easy use accurate programmable lights up easy read decent quality like korg has never disappointed me got help clean strings after constant playing help preserve them keep them from having oils from fingers cause them fail saves some money replacements found another product actually gets top bottom better cleaning strings so like better far whole purpose cleaning strings use apply cleaner fingerboard now deeper cleaning
711	 pignose world best travel amp or portable amp or practice amp very good vocals inefficient what its year old design distorts way too easy there far better amps most purposes from boss others deliver lot more clean volume thanks modern class d amp technology variety digital effects boot there one area where pig prevails if re looking sound big overdriven amp studio or miked stage pignose will give sound less than cost one good quality overdrive pedal by opening closing box can get range cabinet sounds from open back fender classic marchall sealed cab everything between frank zappa recorded lot his parts using nothing his sg running into pignose he got fantastic sounds beyond cool looking reasonably rugged even has pegs allow hang from strap every rocker needs one there two ways strings go bad if leave them long enough steel cores bronze windings will actually corrode takes months if more before happens grease from your fingers dust bits skin other detritus from environment gets into strings between windings interferes free vibration strings deadens sound back when strings were lot more expensive some guys used take their strings off regularly clean or even boil them some bass players still do coated strings simpler alternative these strings similar ones like elixirs thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded wrappings which accomplishes two things first creates barrier between atmosphere metal wrap which prevents rust corrosion second provides physical barrier prevents contamination from getting between windings strings stay fresher sounding two or three times long standard strings they do sound just bit less bright than equivalent uncoated strings huge difference after month or two they still sound same they also cost about twice much equivalent non coated d addarios they worth depends if re an active performer maybe re probably changing strings every performance make sure re getting bright sound re probably also buying your strings by box there no real benefit these strings where they really pay off casual player who may few dozen spare sets handy these days m strictly hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice year four acoustic guitars some them may go go month or more without being played coated strings can leave set month or two later can pull out case ready play still change strings if m going be playing public guitars spend most time sitting around house these great was local music store other day noticed huge stack these cymbals few examples mounted stands try while they re rich zildjians or paistes or other more expensive cymbals they do trashy sound look china at asking price who can resist lot epiphone owners learned cases designed gibson es clones won fit epiphone guitars epiphones slightly larger headstock case however fits dot custom like glove padding perfect top arched precisely fit build quality better than might expect at price level thee only flatwound strings ve tried sound significantly better than these thomastiks which cost twice much they re twice good maybe if was working pro d buy thomastiks me d addarios sound good last long time if ve never played flatwounds might be surprised discover they far outlast round wound strings because what kills sound strings gunk from your fingers air getting between windings damping vibration back when strings were more lot more expensive wasn unusual remove strings boil them put them back some electric bassists still do flats gunk doesn get between wraps if don break string can play set months different guitars set up different strings ranging from 010s fenders archtop rockers playing 010s 009s might be intimidated by 013s they re much harder play after little practice easy jazzers seldom if ever play six string bar chords or bend strings which means just don need much muscle anyway flatwounds also generally set fairly low action they don vibrate widely roundwounds so they don need much clearance if re looking classic electric jazz sound flats way go d addarios good need rockers looking 60s sound might try d addario flatwound 010s almost same sound pyramids lot cheaper maybe because cut musical teeth motown 60s rock ve always preferred sound flatwound strings round wound or even ground wound strings might also something do fact play upright well flatwounds easier fingers both hands they natural damping makes them sound more upright like ears doesn hurt good set flat wounds will last practically forever too use d daddarios all electric guitars basses ve found them be very consistent from set set sealed plastic packaging means can buy set today put case be good new year later used use labella flats fretless then switched thomastik jazz flats then friend told me he d switched from thomastiks these he found them much more consistent quality smoother well m now convert too play few stringed instruments ukulele isn one them after seeing so many great uke players lately jake shimaukuro joe brown had hankering try some ukulele playing myself wanted playable instrument didn feel like spending lot money ve tried ukes stores were big disappointments bad intonation no tone etc after reading reviews here elsewhere decided risk purchase result surprisingly good instrument less than fifty bucks sure doesn volume or rich tone soprano solid top delivers good tone excellent intonation good playability at very good price may be star intrument star value if re thinking about trying ukulele re sure want buy an expensive instrument right away would strongly recommend an lu even after buy better uke great one keep hand shove into hands unsuspecting guests so can play ukulele duets was little concerned after reader some reviews here warranty blue reputation amazon customer service convinced me give try general m pretty satisfied using one oktava mk microphones get excellent sound no hum so far excellent reliability m using audacity few other programs none which any difficulty recognizing there were some issues setting up initially m bit leery about plastic construction what paid think good value those thinking using field recording stick inside carrying bag tape cable prevent stressing usb connector shouldn any problems first reaction opening box came was gee lot smaller than expected looks like cad equitek e100s fraction size d even say was cute how does perform two microphones use recording at computer blue yeti usb electret mic sampson samtr101a two yeti closer design uses an electret capsule built usb interface like go mic so what compared fired up garage band plugged both microphones into computer four year old imac so could lay down some parallel instrumental tracks acoustic ukulele double bass right off bat was impressed go mic lack latency was good yeti maybe better there was no perceptible delay no need find special driver either plug ready go there even headphone jack mic something unusual package tiny sound was good too though perhaps uncolored yeti tried all three modes carodid carodid 10bd pad omni omni gave best clearest sound unexpectedly was hard get good level when close miking no matter how backed down volume garage band got clipping using 10db pad was able get some acceptable levels from few feet away best sound all instruments was obtained from feet using omni mode has one advantage over yeti very modest current requirements so can run directly off ipad two together make nice portable recording production combination packaging well thought out too mic permanently attached via swivel strong clip also serves desktop stand when use mic folds into clamp protection if enough there separate case keep dust dirt out mic while go mic wouldn be first choice recording music would be very acceptable one recording musical ideas go perfectly acceptable voice recording podcasting or skyping latest addition desktop most flexible recording device ve yet found blue microphones yeti usb microphone long known their line high end condenser microphones blue increasingly known their computer ready usb microphones like snowflake snowball yeti their latest certainly greatest computer ready microphone yet advertised first fully thx compliant standard devised by lucasfilms microphone yeti large tall its removable stand hefty multi pattern microphone suitable recording podcasting or any other computer related audio activity features four switchable patterns omni carodid figure eight stereo built headphone amplifier gain control headpohone volume mute button even more flexibility can remove from its desk stand mount standard microphone stand or boom sounds great too even better than their well regarded snowball series ve been using recording music practice building tracks audacity windows linux boxes apple garageband making calls skype ability record full stereo or mono real plus up now ve been using variety microphones together various microphone preamps an d converters mass cables power supplies bad enough desk real hassle when trying use laptop away from home yeti has all one package may sound quite good multi thousand dollar condenser microphone vacuum tube preamp money simply can be beat ve been playing d addario xls their standard gauge sets many years now so was curious see how these new balanced sets would feel expected more even feel across fingerboard experienced something quite different right off b string felt lot stiffer looking at tension table d addario publishes clear why case traditional 01s b string has about lower tension e g these new sets b at same tension which say under more tension than b traditional set significant increase if re used lower tension balanced tension feels lot stiffer at first higher tension string requires different amount compensation at bridge too which means changing setup easily done telecaster where changing length b changes length e well being higher tension new b should require more compensation since ll shift pitch even more when depress stretch since tele currently set up close could get e b perfect comnpensation didn feel like playing after playing while set started feel more natural me don think ll be changing gauges tele right away about dozen 010s stock well over dozen 013s fro archtop may experiment bit new gauges epiphone dot custom which string 011s m wondering if balanced sets will give me more even string string feel if so would be worth effort change over tascam had first inexpensive multitrack recorder market even competitors entered market they ve managed stay top ve owned or borrowed models from fostex korg going back several decades tascam always seems be out front when comes ease use value even market evolved from cassette digital tascam recorders kept same feel ease use had boss micro br while found all menu interface annoying difficult use kept forgetting sequences set up rhythm tracks record mix down ended up having repeat things over over soon sold then replaced tascam dp when appeared market tascam wasn really any more powerful than boss lacked built rhythm tracks had fewer menus more actual switches knobs made more intuitive use more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette based recorder after dp tascam produced follow six track unit recorder track dp when was first introduced couple years ago really was revolutionary unit there were plenty track recorders out there none were small inexpensive also more than just dp more tracks dp has much improved mastering ability allows adjust eq compression effects individually tracks mix down while leaving original tracks unaffected like dp has built microphones can also be used direct stereo recording unlike dp comes an external power supply box option original can use an external battery pack ve been playing all weekend doing mixture stereo multitrack recordings one thing noticed right off was there significant amount noise monitor mix while multitracking was afraid would translate into noisy recordings noise isn there finished playback also noticed while basic recording functions more or less unchanged from those new mixdown functions much more complex required constant reference manual mentioned previously there an awful lot capability there going take some time be able use effectively most functionality menu based rather than being accessibly directly from front panel say one thing don really care only input device select functions parameters menus scroll wheel nearly comfortable knob or mouse or touchpad most recording lately has been done various apple platforms at home use garage band imac usb equipped alesis console input away from home use garage band ipad ultimate portability ipod touch all these platforms much more intuitive use than dp much more powerful course they re also lot more expensive lack built stereo microphones ability plug instruments microphones directly without some sort additional interface having xlr connectors well inputs really nice touch something never saw portables from few years ago like old school approach dp well all one package approach if was just starting out home multitrack recording didn lot spend think dp might be good choice really good enough produce music band first cd releases costs less than decent microphone full tracks there no need do track bouncing get four instruments four voices down if really need can bounce add further six tracks giving all don think going replace ipod pocket portability or ipad functionality garage band gives me full orchestra keyboards drums well having microphones instrument preamps built does make much easier set up use live recording should get lot use at home elsewhere coming year ve been using d addario xl nickel wounds p bass long time they lot tone they seem last long time they re very expensive these strings same feel nickel wounds lot brighter get lots overtones high end from these choice gauges little different from regular xls too instead e they e just enough give slightly more solid low end more metal dig into while retaining low tension d g m more an old school player prefer nickel mellower sound if re into funk or more modern sounds may feel bright ss sound if so these great string ve been thinking about trying nanoweb strings while was bit put off by high price they cost about twice much uncharted strings ve been buying comments some reviewers tone coated strings noticeably duller was intrigued by promise long life though taylor big baby bought used which came set nanowebs had probably been year they didn sound at all like old strings review set gave me chance finally see myself how they sound when new d just changed strings 1970s gibson gospel week ago so decided would be reference nanowebs went 1970s guild d both well broken solid spruce top guitars gospel bit brighter sounding m pretty familiar sound both guitars if they d sounded dull d notice was unwrapping nanowebs noticed while they were labeled light gauge they had e string something d be more likely find set medium gauge strings b was compared d addarios usually play rest strings were there usual light gauges turns out these hd light gauge designed slightly more tension better articulation at high end difference shouldn be enough require any truss rod adjustment so went ahead installed them d so how do they sound unwound e b don sound different from any other plain steel string course e does feel tiny bit stiffer when switch between d gospel sound wise d say they sound like good set been day wouldn call them dull by any stretch imagination if didn know they were coated strings certainly wouldn be able tell from playing them so they re good sounding strings they last long time leaves question cost they worth twice price uncoated strings here way see if re heavy strummer or playing gigs every night maybe re probably breaking strings or losing them metal fatigue long before they d go dull from corrosion or contamination if re finger picker or light strummer coated string will probably save lot money long run if re hobby player who keeps around house picks up once while entertain friends or family coated strings probably an excellent choice myself m going leave these d long they still sound good ll update review when find out just how long they do last follow up after playing these few days actually went out bought set same gauge loar lh an arch top carved top gets played more than any other guitars they sound great loar now two guitars do long term test

720	 ok little cheaper quality than expected would recommend going little higher price also arrived cracked prefer shar overture premieres which same price these ones little too bright sound deep or resonant enough also bear mind these dominants which clearly far superior which would be paying set does work described arrives without any instructions whatsoever its fairly obvious figure out reason only gave two stars however because find so uncomfortable its quite hard your collarbone added foam now works well suspect one might be better just buying foam one first place basically very good buttons fairly intuitive some basic functions incongrously hidden beneath multiple layers menus sound recorded while crystal clear little quiet side even after adjustment record play back features

742	 originally purchased these strings because gauges wanted set strings would slightly lighter tension than regular set light gauge which usually somewhere around upon installing these strings can really see much difference size from regular light gauge maybe too small notice naked eye m entirely sure these strings were louder or marked improvement over old daddario strings they replaced they might be little brighter or more clarity due being new m using them small body nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice smooth overall m satisfied sound performance new strings don think m ready give up daddarios yet second fender polish cloth they basic all need quick wipe down instrument after m done playing only slight negative fact they tend unravel around edges even though has happened me didn keep me from buying second one fact they basic inexpensive good enough me gets softer time use overall say m satisfied fender polish cloth love dunlop formula polish cleaner works really well like easy use pump spray mechanism ve used other brands past they had poor spray nozzles one works almost like mist does good job removing smudges fingerprints spray directly surface then wipe off flannel cloth after m done shine looks glassy great
743	 ernie ball really something slinky series offering nice range weights swear by slinky after being conned into set mexican made martins from moment started using noticed radio signal overlay when used mini amp headphones trying out few new types picks different weights found pick very responsive flying through scales les paul pick weight was perfect durable easy gripping sure pretty looking cable out box chord works great no noticeable buzz had tweed complement vintage gear d given star rating because tweed fabric outer chord constantly fighting kinks bought pick looking options around old dropped pick syndrome was skeptical pick at first glance seems slicker than most however once between thumb index finger these darlings hang

748	 great highs lows rough fingertips difficult doing barre chords slides single string progressions ok more effort
749	 use clamped table superb product tablet touchpad they both work very well nice mount great value buy manufacturer website claimed case would fit les paul style an esp eclipse even close chromacast products great they need fix info their web page m fan shaped les paul cases too bad what great frame stand especially money lightweight super stable like so much ordered three more all electric guitars fit wonderfully onto stand do acoustics similarly priced fender leans wayyy too far back couldn hoped more from these stands buy one buy couple
750	 an opinion strings fairly subjective said ve been stringing jackson soloist w floyd rose these strings years ve never had problem wouldn buy anything else live arizona keep acoustic case dampit unless m playing seems do good job although would recommend purchasing better meter one comes simple paper design gives decent estimate these great tuners they look great ve never had lot interest locking tuners except floyd rose guitars much say about one genuine fender trem cover will do its job well
751	 ve used quite few strings out there imo these best feel sound overall quality if play fender instruments can go wrong using their strings course strings subjective thing so each his own will say used different strings most life was store one day picked up tele was immediately impressed strings looked at back noticed they were colored ends so thought they were d addario strings which found be odd considering was new fender so did little research found fender was indeed doing colored ends now well been buying them ever since love them makes changing strings whole lot easier if player changing strings like was without one these stop get one trust me while don ton experience pedals really love one keeps your guitars tone can add some fatness mild fairly substantial crunch adds some nice sustain although tube overdrive actually think sounds better solid state amp nothing real drastic exactly what was looking nice robust boost while keeping your tones integrity price don see how can beat pedal also digitech jam man awesome no complaints outfit so far power supply great pretty compact light come all power cables need does job at far more reasonable price at other power supplies was considering no complaints here
752	 honestly strings great they sound great they relatively inexpensive bass strings love them they will be what buy next time change out well highly recommended great strings affordable used these quite while always liked them recently moved boston though here they seem rust really quickly they never used too its humid here so don know if got some bunk strings or if quality has gone down last year or if really its boston weather historically sworn by these though great strings use these deering goodtime ii they work well deering recommends imagine most entry level banjo manufacturers sticking only light gauge light pluses or mediums so stock up good strings overly prone corrosion daisy chain worked very well me no problems yet m powering about six pedals currently am able use more than one without any problems or change sound think great way power some basic effects without breaking bank should work any single spot c adapter might already so no need buy another nice thumbpicks banjo they size large so if generally very large hand they will be tight larger hand they work well they about micrometer away from being too snug like them lot would also work fine acoustic picking if whay re into though always preferred acoustic picking without thumbpick
753	 ve always played light gauge strings really wanted more sound out so found these just took gamble medium light set was disappointed there was an immediate notice sound difference also playablility became little more challenging they offer very warm tone very good balance overall throughout strings ve always liked ernie ball strings these were great starter set me upgrade would recommend any level player read several reviews before purchasing these strings ve never bought any strings any sort coating them after putting these yamaha acoustic sounded great they very good high low tones give more resonating tone whole yamaha very expensive model these strings make sound like if re wanting upgrade thicker set strings definitely give these try coating supposed make them last longer resist corrosion what they also little smoother fingertips when changing chord positions sliding up down fret board may misunderstood product description prefer string tied end acoustic over issue makes really high up when play standing position there no way adjust strap make longer if play sitting down lot then would probably work don get me wrong there was nothing wrong product itself just wasn what thought was using nylon strap before got one love feel fact its little wider than older strap leather feels very high quality end pieces fit snug acoustic don worry coming loose ordered capo thursday received mail following tuesday had never used capo design so was little skiptical figured price might well give try thing works great there name brand looks really good acoustic spring very tight ensure good quality sound when moving up down fret board only used kyser capos past one works just well only drawback make sure clamps down evenly fret changing keys otherwise ll get some rattling noise from strings once get hang placing where need works very fast when need change keys

786	 like product so much buy them two at time wish didn problem everyone else likes much me so like guy who asks lighter uses puts his pocket every single time these also seem grow feet disappear just like lighter understand people coveting tools work well so convenient if turns them into kletptos maybe should contain stain pack catch them like bank robbers decent tool at good price so buy one then see how long can own after years buying stands all can say should invented myself many expensive guitars wouldn use inexpensive stand before found design so if re shopping wonder if really good can trust me because m way over qualified pass judgement care about guitars about amazon shoppers ve been recording professionally years music radio commercials television mostly so ll try give information need make your purchase ve owned used so many mics brands through years can remember them all can say ve never had bad use every week years going back mid just lower priced electret condenser from family no idea recordings re hearing brand used by almost every studio every continent work us italy scotland can attest first let me tell very simply where negative reviewers went wrong xlr connection phantom powered mic which pro best so requires phantom powered xlr input which all pro equipment provides standard most home recording audio interfaces which should really purchase along if haven already because around ll improve your recording playback preamp monitoring ll find one by searching audio interfaces rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand focusrite use just playback office den they work well don need avid hd get started audio interface just another name an external sound card will provide proper input gain meter getting your interface away from electronically noisy computer has been sop since dawn digital see small usb mixers available which would be another option don try an adapter won work needs power through cord charge field effect transistor power supplies available after adapt however want doesn come cord what surprise quality cords will cost about half price version will probably do most doesn come ashock mountbut can purchase one if like work may need one recorded vibrations rumbling will tell do ll need windscreen popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris usual can also recommend using large foam screens top cut from one mic side address will need cover entire screen isn about being cheap there times goosenecks very inconvenient don work at strange angles ll probably always need one or other does come stand so pick up boom stand if don one pay no attention negative reviewers will tell they tip over wheelers also tip over recommendeduse sandbag or whatever leg opposite mic or remove boom top portion slide barbell weight put back together or create proper counterweight where they ve put faux plastic one if possible could mount boom from ceiling run cable hooks eliminating vibration from floor while keeping cable out waymicrophone flange male desktop users here what d do using large command strips velcro d fasten deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini boomhere another optionmxl mics mxl bcd standunderstand recording has progressed by meeting needs experimenting if need something figure out your clean quiet recording proof works can justify comparing mics like if there better value buy wouldn bought case most condensers sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics certainly an entry level professional mic many situations could be substituted without issue also individual mics sound eight prefer them use them most so when reviewers say bright say compared what can tell what sounds like ka ching great sound audio recording uh huh know one professional recording client was clueless used an mic think about would be good what was used years ago heard good recordings anyone purchasing equipment because sounds better ought earned enough slap down cash pay lot reviewers opinions about mic so don ignore them ask yourself do they formal training experience different mics many studios they using expensive gear from their console their monitors reveal its true capabilities any noticeable increase sound quality might cost won be half what ll achieve by improving your recording technique type mic excellent overhead acoustics amps or brass course vocals really most recording needs having less uni more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern better suited recording just understand can get too loud near or ll overdrive since designed up screaming vocals so back off loud amps brass which also means need quiet place recording because ll pick up your ac ducts your neighbor tv good thing what bad trying do good recording noisy environment so don blame mic your extraneous room noise can just use different microphone or noise gates or processors any kind just quiet anything else pail sinking ship because an acoustical rather than electronic signal noise ratio 10db pad will reduce output doesn affect diaphragm its input acoustical foam won help even its purpose suggest reading acoustics foam music tutsplus dot com tutorials beginners guide acoustic treatment audio just replace dot turn off your heat air be careful headphone bleed do your recording between am when world quieter place will really help ll likely hear how loud your computer fans can get underground your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions need quiet ve known acoustic players who ve worn gas masks cut sound their breathing if what your budget allows an excellent first step into recording type mic likely brand would be first choice first recording mic no matter cost keep saying type mic reason why because sells models like style up model lowest priced re buying reputable brand if your future plans include using only one mic without ability use any traditional recording hardware can look here audio technica at2020 usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at2020usb cardioid condenser microphone w pop filterthis advice will also lose higher quality playback supplied recording software comes an interface model usb now pay no attention descriptions how sounds won tell because how sounds me system won apply your system goes all audio descriptions worthless only unplugging one piece gear another matters important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn recording cannot sound better than source so microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than different microphone accurate or inaccurate good or bad there difference during mix make better or different from original sound apply these same thoughts your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than recording why accuracy important your monitors so search out any info don understand don expect be competent engineer without years schooling training having worked professional setting if re lucky like was after year tech school worked site repair studios often need pt apprenticed while continuing education next then after years work tv another year school became studio owner real recording involves facility equipment techniques involved surgeon hospital so study electronics acoustics auditory cortex everything audio train yourself hear smallest sounds all day never stops when making any purchases recommend reading research realize tool because can buy tool doesn mean re educated its use so yes also don recommend buying scalpel trying surgery your little brother unless everyone us started somewhere so get some equipment start recording quit all sleeping eating other unnecessary activities just read record just short sessions at real studio will also open your eyes be educational some will allow just stop talk so keep up research because no man knows all m just here help out if need good small inexpensive

coated strings were by far favorite strings acoustic d addario has finally made string comparable maybe little tiny bit better than elixir these very nice bright strings coating incredibly subtle almost impossible feel strings like compared elixir these bit brighter good feel call me old school hate packaging these strings packaged three two string loops inside single plastic bag ah know m just so used strings individually looped two strings looped together makes mess while m restringing when unwrap pair ve got string has sit out unwrapped bench neat freak me hates also dislike strings one plastic bag yeah get they trying be more environmentally responsible darn paper envelopes feels me like they just trying cheapen up packaging materials some environmental cause post consumer recycled paper adds very little environmental load know d addario loves color coded ends acoustic irrelevant ends hidden inside behind pegs electric guitars don like look at all prefer gold or silver rings at end if strings individual labeled packages there no need colors d addario loves color coded end rings so much they do horrible job color coding simplifying their packaging yet decode their colors or naming system normally use gauge strings acoustic tested these at gauge am surprised how much like them slightly thicker string bad oddly these strings priced almost same elixir reason using original d addario strings low price if somebody doing gigs nightly those uncoated strings only way go strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue gigging musician home enthusiast coated strings make ton sense they do last longer think they worth premium price now there two choices excellent coated strings end packaging color coded end rings crazy package coding double looped strings all mean nothing once strings what they sound like play like most important thing regard these excellent strings brush used remove static electricity light dust from records before each playing deep cleaning dust or dirt removal brush compliment record cleaning solutions like excellent liquid cleaner by last last pc power cleaner oz brush super simple use album your turntable hold at roughly ninety degree angle about two revolutions then sweep off lp no fuss no muss no fooling around never touch carbon fiber your fingers when there visible dust fibers give brush good flick by rotating handle across fibers after each use rotate handle around cover fibers if press brush too hard against album or do deep dive sharp angle trick fibers will be broken off brush just press lightly against rotating lp sweep brush off lp all will be wonderful brush brush sold under many different brand names clearaudio audioquest thorens brush comes no instructions use an odd omission maybe there an assumption brush so easy use instructions would be redundant audiophile or brush must anyone still loves analog recordings tried these laguna acoustic they basic standard traditional strings they sound good they light weight they sound bit too bright preference use elixirs prefer feel sound elixir polyweb acoustic strings light these strings do last less time than elixirs mostly fresh strings sound good some people like brand new set before every gig others will go weeks or months before changing if an every gig person well martin set probably perfect they much less expensive than others leaving strings an extended period elixirs or other coated strings probably better idea there no such thing perfect string every choice all about your personal preference

excellent storage tube d addario balanced tension strings good value worth slightly higher price these excellent strings type gigging musician would likely use their they inexpensive sound great somebody casual home musician coated strings might be better choice difference somebody plays two or three hours every day will wear out set strings long before corrosion sets somebody plays an hour or two twice week will likely never wear out their strings corrosion becomes bigger problem big question me balanced tension worth little extra money seems like yes they strings slightly easier bend feel just little bit better there isn huge difference direct comparison string d addario exl110 d addario exl110 nickel wound electric strings regular light at roughly set these good solid strings at bargain price exl110bt strings about set if were going through set strings every few days exl110 would probably be better idea if set going last week or two savings overall pretty small would use exl110bt personal preference coated strings like elixir strings lot new d addario coated strings fine they end up being about same price elixir ll stick what know well lucille did love these strings they worked out just fine packaging don like what d addario has done all strings single plastic package prefer individual paper envelopes they loop two strings together hate when m stringing like work one string at time silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up bench sometimes strings get crossed over when unlooping them makes me mess strings while they trying save packaging good thing seriously little paper wouldn kill anybody also don care color coded rings strings lucille has an open bridge where can see those electric colors small thing don like prefer rings all be brass one

866	 there no such thing best string from experimenting over years ve found while old standbys will be first thing try often there string just right particular varies from coated strings become all rage over last few years they re expensive they last lot longer especially if kind body chemistry causes them corrode quickly also they minimize amount finger noise get if slide strings elixir polywebs were first coated string coating much heavier than other strings produces much less bright more muted sound an old koa so bright can stand standard strings elixir polywebs tone down point where perfect if re looking darker sound then elixir polywebs definitely worth shot if want coated string prefer brighter sound uncoated strings then definitely don want polywebs stars applies if want particular type sound if don want sound could end up awarding them star don classical just got an inexpensive really fun steel string non radiused fingerboard ve also got over dozen capos don ask all radiused fingerboards fingerboards most steel string guitars electric acoustic radiused they flat they gentle curve them so gentle many wouldn notice unless they looked closely look up fingerboard wikipedia an excellent discussion google images diagrams pictures even though curve gentle if fingerboard radiused capo must be curved too or outside strings would be pressed down properly would buzz if fingerboard flat like classical capo must be flat too or center strings will be pressed down properly will buzz if re sure whether your fingerboard radiused slide ruler between two frets if lies flat then so fingerboard if rocks fingerboard radiused really like capo because way pressure adjusted by turning tension screw makes possible exert just right amount pressure tool little which would cause strings buzz too much which would cause instrument go out tune others noted its one drawback can be clamped headstock when use d replace most capos radiused versions capo highly recommended year ago wrote lengthy comparison theedirol r wave mp3 recorder blackand thezoom h4 handy recorder 2gb accessory kit pre accessory kit wanted high quality easy use recorder so even though h4 had all features edirol sold considerably less kept edirol because was so much easier use zoom has responded h2 scaled down version h4 all features r all controls right where need them h2 even has additional features over r they don get way example there choice degree recording pattern degree recording pattern even surround sound option samsontech has some nice video demonstrations its website one big complaint ve had edirol cost its add stand unlike edirol h2 comes simple stand addition h2 has threaded hole so can be mounted standard digital camera tripod separate note much easier replace batteries h2 than edirol recently got together friends recorded same live acoustic music both edirol r zoom h2 used adobe audition only normalize both tracks equalize their loudness first time we played them back thought detected very slight preference edirol overall opinion group split between two units second time we played them back preference was h2 overall opinion continuing be split we all agreed differences were so small be negligible if there were any at all do prefer edirol control buttons h2 membrane m about sell edirol perhaps because am more familiar edirol don want give up just yet also edirol r darling moment however if owned neither couldn justify huge bump price edirol over h2 would opt h2 when went music party last weekend knew d need only one recorder grabbed h2

stop rotating found way sound strings decays difficult get rings stop spinning even sc sustain mode ve already returned tuner otherwise just realized would been big help done short video tuning sc zoid or intelli sc also boasts sweetened mode tuning guitars however when tuned lounging at home way found needle was dead center every string intelli tuner those who ve read other reviews preferred zoid was case favorite may well be others may report sc feature set make ideal other situations however if main purpose keep tune then sc costing more than three zoidszoid z clip tuner by sabineor four intellisintelli imt500 clip chromatic digital tuner strings recommend consider zoid or intelli anyone who cares take time look at other reviews will see am fond snark displays prefer needle type

generate tandum instrument bring out best resonance sustainability give em try tried many types steel strings taylor came delivered these though tried several others returned them their ease play smoothness fret finger light rich tonality makes them good choice your string haven tried em yet pick up set they different many ways better than more standard phosphor bronze strings were best before these came along new type design capos manufactued england warranteed life truly wonderful available six twelve string steel string well new classical version they all easy use solidly built perhaps most importantly easy put take off one hand without having retune musician most cricial element kind materials used manufacture good use mine martin hd28 had no problems whatsoever great move toward new generation capos cheap worth every cent little history been player forty odd some them very odd years first thirty them tuned by ear starting by guessing at what low e sounded like then tuning other five strings by fretting listening tuning could never understand why tuning often sounded perfect one chord yet remained off others took quite long time get right then about ten years ago thought had figured out problem thought was guesses at true e were off so got myself an e tuning fork cycles used tune first string then did had always done fretted tuned other five much better result kept having tune retune quite while get all chords sound right during those years tried tuning all six strings what believed was an accurately tuned piano well by ear tones available online nothing gave me better tuning first try then saw an ad chromatic tuner lightening struck realization there been many each which has led me closer what now near perfect tuning first go round first off realized when we say e just one note range literally hundreds perhaps even thousands specific tones same true every note akin guess realization child no matter how many shades blue box crayons chanced having precise shade want specific drawing rare purchasing first chromatic tuner ct440 manufactured by switchmucic sold through musiciansfriend com moved me long way along continuum learning accurate tuning however tuner had at least two limitations firstly construction rather light flimsy works ok has second limitation conaused me buy korg about same price korg has built tone generator speaker allowing option tuning way rather than having only single option having tones made by instrument read metered back both tuners plug electric instruments so far can tell their accuracies similar prefer korg reasons mentioned additionally korg can be manually recalibrated special tuning needs remembers original tuning tones so can return more standard usage nice extra piece flexibility lcd meter easy read colored lights tell right away whether sharp flat by how much or right point surprising interest tuning fork had used years turns out be profoundly flat shock me given had grown up learning tuning forks gave off perfect tones saved reminder all things what they promoted be guess round pitch pipe ms sweeny used tune up class 5th grade was probably quite precise she would presumed finally marvelous little inexpensive device well constructed accurate flexible allow many different tuning need situations circumstances assume there will be still higher places learning curve area rise right now am using regularly all stringed instruments two six string martins twelve string epiphone frailing banjo time saves tuning string alone makes more than own price if discovered chromatic tuning maybe really was last one discover these things suggest do so immediately spend your time enjoying pleasures making music rather than sitting frustration trying adjust tunings by ear so sounds really right perhaps people perfect pitch can do very nicely without chromatic tuner am one them used many clip tuners they wonderful innovation certainly easier use than older rectangular chromatic tuners do attach instrument one favorites has become planet waves clip several them use them often many guitars based experience was anticipating better experience new mini headstock tuner than wound up getting tunes nicely so far ear concerned accurately others found awkward attach did small unobtrusive easy read those problems what wrong simply cheap fragile construction device fragility conspicuous both difficulty removing battery cover more importantly too delicate manual clamp used fasten onto an instrument fundamental issue lieu spring clips we used attach other versions planet waves tuners guitars one has basic manual expand contract clamp clamp made out thin plastic difficult adjust expect break after only short time consequently cannot recommend tuner if user needs be moving from one instrument other if need tuner attaches one instrument will essentially live there nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible all player if need move tuner from instrument instrument would be well advised spend few more dollars stick clip versions planet waves tuners november updatehaving used tuner while now found has good purpose while tuned does mobility issues initially noted been surprised pleased realize they wonderful permanent tuners acoustic guitars they so small be unobtrusive nearly invisible leave them strings one non built built tuner at price cannot be beat based belated realization raised product rating stars having played years tried used many many capos back day was bar plastic held place by length elastic didn work very well what was available me later some technology was applied need necessary accessory would hold all six strings firmly place tune was placed up down neck without doing anything damage fret board or finish neck many good capos been made until now perhaps best options been g7 which fails its softness allows strings slip schubb which unfortunately snaps into place way can injure neck instrument new ns tri action capo from planet waves accomplishes both requirements consistently effectively designed by ned steinberger ns tri action works trigger spring lever mechanism works all way up down neck fits perfectly first attempt holds all six strings firmly place does so way causes no abrupt jolt neck both g7s schubbs better known more commonly used more expensive one those rare instances where what get what pay d addario famous string maker produces planet waves line accessories has done remarkable welcome job these capos any player who has gone from one other capo over time searching one really does what supposed do all time will find new capo from planet waves welcome tool quest produce clear tones great sounds six string had used elixer strings several years both string guitars somehow had

879	 ll never use another string acoustics reduced finer squeak long lasting coating great tone these strings wonderful ve tried couple cheaper brands recently both coated uncoated come back these every time before we get started am more pro than amateur work at church pastor worship use work hesitate say m only pro because amateur means do something purely love feel way about music so first models ve tested far away more realistic ears than other modelers ve used which includes logic studio amps these sound almost good btw pod x3live xtpro hd models noticeably better fizz gone gone gone original pod which sounded same me made me happy at time tonelab se which missed while anymore made few patches one guitars based having bassman 4x10 alongside dr z coolest sound ve ever made easily better sounding ears than real amps ve been using maybe because put them off stage don run them very loud adore sound unit oh always forget about all pre sets they re probably all useless imagine they might be now bad news significant some first off editing clunky like was xt x3live just forget about trying use display connect computer seriously when start from an init patch only get lucky seems manage coax into two amp config next functionality unit exaggerated by specs will almost certainly be able do fx at once way re thinking why let say use an xt or x3 think about what re used start fxsubtract effect banks volume pedal need use an effect bank might be able use an analog pedal like volume after compressor so do loop guess fx loop only works an effect bank line6 there any way can make always active firmware upgrade seems like could noise gate used be always available don worry if mix m13 plan do though m13 has great gate mostly use clean or just barely broken up amps so might be able skip wah always available active x3 below post eq x3live had final eq before final output liked lot addition all other fx too need dedicate an fx bank now so might only 3fx left me put clean boost tube drive which think sound better box than they did m13 probably because they re digitally part signal all can think verb amp no slots left what if need delay modulation eek re think way use fx box still evaluating how will work me what if re guy like me who was using x3live occasionally one box solution dual voice all guitars piezo bridges no dice will use an acoustic preamp no matter one will probably dedicate null amp bring signal into unit mix addition there aren many computer recording routing options x3live super sweet ability switch between two fx chains one patch instead switching programs gone far back old vox tonelab se could literally switch channels from one amp cab another same fx chain could do something similar x3live here also line why earth can make midi out work usb midi interface unit how complicated can really be short x3live has significantly significantly more flexibility imho than unit many us at least ought been discontinued imho some still viable option also still might need your other fx thought might be possible unit even if needed use ag stomp acoustic side again which m happy do would bump m13 off stage did at first after while did indeed get rid m13 don miss said think from what m hearing some fx especially dirt pedals work far better inside box than they do m13 when connect pod or amp favorite patches so far ve made which use bassman model unbelievable dr z model far away favorite amp model evah don leave any room modulation or other special fx m switch whole patches fly guy turn fx off after bit tweaking patch making discovered sounds didn need dual amp chains often so all flexibility back so am complaining about these limitations no because sound unit so extraordinary d take off full star shortcoming fact unit sounds good enough can do there will at some point hope be next generation technology which will possibly address some usability shortcomings say price am totally satisfied sound meantime am willing trade flexibility former rig sound one heck yes sounds good even love models amps know ll never use first time ever after few months experimenting was able make patches completely worked two voice stuff no additional outboard gear if didn want so ve simplified where wanted no longer feel like m really compromising anything so started rig consisting hd500 sometimes an m13 an acoustic preamp currently yamaha ag stomp mixed hd signal through aux input ve now gotten point where can do everything want if need without additional pedals sold m13 kept few analog pedals such just like rarely take them out house anymore m only nit picking so will know all trade offs what been fantasizing about basically an m13 form function handful amp models shoved box close we re probably going come did mention sound seriously great update learned will indeed no problem replacing m13 well sold off thought d miss don update february supplemented product black james tyler variax jtv59 korean marriage made heaven if going go product if looking new check out new variaxes totally amazing don get me wrong improvement over old formulation noticeable there little more brightness output they little more long lasting they stay tune quicker longer than normal xl120 good string looks like going rate these strings will be bucks set can get three sets regular excellent xl120 strings money if nyxl lasted times long then they d be worthwhile ve been able try them twice now they don last times long great string great innovation great achievement drastically overpriced was looking forward trying these ve loved company product since day one think they ve messed around gauge slapped meaningless hd tag added few bucks price more profit someone pocket marketing jargon smaller bodied so these should by their claim given me better balance imho opposite happened bottom dropped out top end stopped sizzling middle strings totally took over when strum pick when play fingers better worth spending more money than normal 012s ve been using which think liked lot better possible these work great taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed color me skeptical d say if re happy what need try these again long time user big fan paying extra money slightly different gauge silly hd moniker no thanks

886	 hesitate write review simply because pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings be honest was very very impressed their feel handling do think they re best playing strings ve used when comes pure playability hands down none better they were butter smooth great flat picking me was trade off because simply wasn impressed tone even took time try them three different guitars all dreadnoughts classic maple sides spruce top mahogany back sides spruce top maple backs sides nato top all three didn like tone much strings was using really wanted like them they simply didn tone medium gauge martin sps normally use isn say they re great strings sound different other peoples guitars simply didn like them mine love good projection rich bass tones ringing treble folk traditional music play our jam group elixirs just lacked punchy high tones martin strings use treble sounds tinny vs clear ring martins normally use be fair bass strings sound great aren much different would say choose your strings carefully based upon how re going use them play acoustic groups elixir strings just don what need be heard spite how great they feel under your fingers if playability more important than great tonal range then by all means buy these strings won be disappointed m guessing these would be fine an acoustic electric where electronics could compensate weaker treble tones these strings aren everyone probably what want everyday normal playing if re looking fast playing string bright sound string addition putting them also six string banjo tuning just couldn get sound wanted from regular strings light guage nickel strings were recommended me they were exactly what was looking they clear bright sound great picking strumming play lot bluegrass irish music feel these strings ideal purpose use lot d addario strings various instruments think they offer most bang buck terms quality tone can pay more don think get much more although these were intended electric they also work well resonator guitars based upon some other reviews feel got different product didn fit descriptions given by others ordered two these both were very thin material sturdy at all second both straps were adjustable both mine measured from strap button hole strap button hole fully extended they useless me dreadnought covers middle chest when put believe was given substitute product since when ordered these straps price was just now they re back up write m really sick these amazon substitutions what paid won bother returning them worth hassle will donate them local music teacher who has students smaller guitars very disappointed warning if see price drop below don buy probably product described here definitely high tech since don own classic looking or vintage mandolin don really care about looks primary concerns comfort function product gets five stars both counts really like fact can attach contact points using click locks remove strap from instrument while leaving contact points place also if get strap twisted up while installing just undo click locks take out twist reattach pure function strap was very well designed thought out before going manufacture five stars chose its good looks was pleased by its construction well very well made strap great looks super price only complaint which very minor think webbing could be thicker more sturdy feel just feels lighter than like personal thing no complaints about construction looks or price use mine an irish bouzouki really looks great works great don like straps smooth liners allow strap slide around cloth doesn slide around good thing lots friends who play these strings some love them more than any other string some like me they re clearly good strings love way they play feel fingertips can get past sound could just be about how strings sound particular guitars any case m happy sound why hard time giving them solid five star rating tried these two separate guitars play regularly wasn terribly impressed sound either one vintage dreadnought mahogany normally has excellent tone crisp clear fairly loud these strings softened tone which wasn looking do they sound okay nowhere near good martin sps use really bring out best also cutaway electric acoustic use sing because fairly quiet softer tones don drown out voice these strings made even more quiet there was considerable drop off tone quality well they might been cheap old strings because couldn tell there was anything special about them particular didn spectacular sound begin these strings did nothing improve like strings either sound good other strings or improve tone pull more from these strings did neither me however they sound just great when instrument was plugged through an amp based upon experimentation would guess if great sounding re fanatic about slight drops tonal quality ll love way these strings feel play rate them excellent category me tone equation d play wire wrapped rope if sounded better than regular strings tonal category these strings fell short excellent tone noticed distinct drop tone quality another softer more muted tone quality vanished final analysis if re picker your can be plugged ll love these strings if re really into great acoustic tone your doesn stellar tone begin might gain some playability will most likely experience slight drop tonal quality
887	 owned other capos one simply best doesn take up lot room fret yet springs strong will hold properly long time price these strings can go wrong however compared elixers sound just isn full did research buy looked at lot reviews well youtube reviews comparing other headphones these seemed be clear favorites over other competitors such beats pro which re spending at least total just name alone such rip off if ask me these very clear fine tuned only knock these they could use little more padding top head
888	 bought set they were recommended get tone was looking week old installed usual tuned them they sounded good when played open compressing them was nearly impossible capo could even hold them set aside few minutes heard wood creaking when looked face was bowing up bridge was pulling up back if they were trying pry off released tension all strings fast could left returned them got some lighter ones no avail body cracked around bridge useless now use at your own risk personally wouldn give nickel them works great much can say beyond great strings use ernie ball strings all guitars both acoustic electric never had complaint experimented others always come back them bought these now me few friends they work great am sure they will wear out time so couple extras can beat them saw tuner local music store decided order here within minutes had tuned sounds perfect compared plug tuning microphone tuning was identical honestly expected some variance was dead never heard sound so good am super impressed little thing if ever need another one only one will get got them days love them so much cheaper than stores they same thing much can say headline says all works well shipping takes time price who cares if need now go local if time wait perfect ordered two just case nice does damage finish at all
889	 basically same other stand rated just from different manufacturer same basic materials can go wrong either see other review world tour gs folding tripod stand honestly can tell them apart since threw out boxes favorite light weight stand simple does job try avoid stands lever locking mechanisms at neck rest which pain arse when trying switch guitars fly these lightweight collapsible so can take them anywhere sturdy enough normal use if re klutz no stand will be sufficient unless encased carbonite switch goes fender blues jr iii series tube amps connector well hidden up underneath main badge back amp reach up underneath find these single channel amps foot switch activates fat switch which gives little extra boost folks playing single coil pickups an lp or other double coil switch almost overkill switch amp sturdy portable little extra weight worth investment if ever want put music book rather than single sheet music your stand those flimsy backless music stands worthless imo especially breezy evening bandmates upgrading stand well we primarily play indoors guess at least one us bit windbag
890	 number guitars keep them all stand music room stand sturdy protects well delay pedal doesnt give massive distortion nice bit fuzz m impressed what get price one spot works very nicely pedal board chain everything needed came combo making ready go right out box seems do nothing an effect draws power reducing volume your instrument well amp sure if just broken pedal or if just junk when received package did appear be damaged tried different amps get same results regardless amp or instrument

894	 bought these strings after buying some elixir strings acoustic which was pretty happy strat however these strings did sound right from start after about week really started wondering if was just head or if really didn sustain thought usually got from new pair strings convinced myself was these strings were causing all problems was right put pair d addario xl highly recommended those players who can decide between 9s or 10s was amazed at how much tone sustain was losing these elixir strings did feel like could move up down fretboard easily these strings lack sustain tone forced me stay way from these electric strings permanently don let higher price these strings entice go good set d addario or ernie ball strings consistent long lasting strings bought these d addario strings after going back forth between 9s 10s really come like these sizes they keep nice slinky feel keep lot tone through many hours playing m really happy d addario purchase these go acoustic strings they quality string great sustain clarity bought elixir nanos compare did like them think get more clarity when chording or hammering these ll be sticking these long run why price some reviews found online had try pedal bought one myself has remained pedalboard since ve bought note recently put right after wah before dirt boxes ve found does two things vibe sound doesn get smooshed retains more rounded sound any volume drop might experience having after some od distortion seems be less suggest playing around trying pedal different places your pedal chain see what works best me will stay before od pedals fuzz do yourself favor check out some youtube demos mine musicman587 pedal after pedals ll get good idea general settings use put these ikea board pedalboard they work great so far no dead cables yet ve been using them months or so
895	 opened package first time didn think much cloth works great cleaning frets even cardboard template does its job obviously cardboard isn going last so purchase metal templates use cloths they comfortable use planet wave logo gives me nice grip pick like heavy picks so heavy option fits preference ve got gig tomorrow night so we ll see how they work then best clip tuner out there dead accurate doesn bounce around like dial needle tuners easy read just clip your headstock either acoustic or electric turn position face toward start tuning very quickly highly recommended all string players especially electric or acoustic or dobro there other tuners by snark more sensitive lower ranges higher ranges so check out what suits your needs
896	 these best strings ever ve tried almost every string market these by far favorite they sound great last forever believe hype they really do last far longer than any other strings they sound great while doing many other strings will sound great short while soon they get gunked up they lose any brilliance tone become dead sounding these they will sound great life string fact only way know change them eventually because they stop sounding good which they don because ll start having intonation problems know strings need be changed normal wear tear does these strings last so long ve tried polyweb strings from elixir well didn like those at all me they didn feel right sticky or something like your fingers stick strings like could tell they were coated nanowebs they sound feel like regular strings last forever only string ll use these tubes just aren me they don sound great kind flat lifeless also unreliable one out arrived doa another has failed since capo works just fine only downside same most capos requires some fine tuning get work different guitars only one ve found doesn kyser go capo years because its design capo adjusts any acoustic vs electric thin neck vs thick etc easily only downside capo sacrifices tiny bit perfect intonation sake ease use capo has similar pinch design spring loaded doesn adjust easily different neck sizes has wheel allows be tightened or widened needs allows bit more accuracy intonation at expense ease use certainly difficult or extremely time consuming capo want use quickly swap between songs so all said still prefer kyser allows much faster changing which me worth slight offset intonation accuracy might be better option if re studio or won ever need use capo more than one song at time or don plan use more than one first place d addario strings like string world they make cheap products cost lot less last lot less time these strings ok ve always been partial nickel wound particularly semi flatwound digress typical strings elixirs so m used them lasting long time case strings sound good like most nickel strings do they didn last long at all before they started sounding dull lifeless stopped keeping intonation accurately so like most d addario strings so they re bad don expect them last like elixirs do get what pay capo pretty good like ability customize tension however which way capo should be put pincer side facing floor or facing ceiling either direction bit awkward put take off angle pincer difficult get right quickly kaiser still best imo can adjust tension those overall good great
897	 liked elixir strings acoustic so knew ones electric would be worth extra money compared non coated brands they seem create less noise from unintentional slide friction sort like difference between flatwound regular strings these feel like super flatwound strings meaning they feel smooth some nice callusses built up imagine d like these strings even more if was just starting out or restarting because imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non coated strings just your typical nylon strap bit stiff durable love celtic design enough use strap ordinarily prefer higher quality materials than nylon plastic construction leather ends leather also bit stiff so stiff functional or reliable if dunlop made cotton steel d pay 4x much love these eliminate pick noise don expect use these your electric they re simply too fat at 11mm they work well bass acoustic however don go soft version they too much give tend stick your strings leave without pick ve been accessory shopping spree lately favorite purchase late ve bought nice straps when m practicing hours at time foot rest great reprieve literally weight off shoulders
898	 sound great last much longer than any other string tried worth extra give them try love being able adjust tension does go sharp like some other capos really clamp down just wish there was an easy way keep handy attaching hardware bit cheap over all better than expected bag was ripped so almost lost screw washer will work fine me think great deal price works fine like all cheap pickups basically makes acoustic sound like clean electric did job what needed now know would love better one like fishman own red blue now black one one best yet very easy read
899	 so easy use just clip ta da screen very easy see tuning banjo breeze unfortunately dog thought was delicious toy mauled beyond recognition so need buy another one if your dog loves toys keep out reach when got thought was cheap toy like thing when put banjo perched head was practically invisible anybody else easy see when needed red when out tune green when tune does small lines tell close being tuned love when am only one using unlike clamp kind like snark hard share clamp seems flimsy ratchets open closed takes little getting used so between husband me using m afraid thing will break play banjo fits nicely head husband has find place at end his acoustical
900	 changing strings string less often fantastic sound good didn expect much volume from light strings tone strings lasts about months experience will depend how much playing get opted use eh its different tonal characteristics sometimes still switch one good quality great sounding tube jj seems be slightly more even tone little bit better sustain low mids if what prefer like tone one better than stock one champ kustom kontender also like more than jj difference subtle jj version seems be bit brighter slightly more noise good way what want me could be used lightweight microphones don bother wasting your money if re using studio microphone base has small circumference so can stick boom out very far at all almost useless there better deals just slightly more money or if really want near studio quality try samson studio boom mic stands strings definitely good tone though ve got them low end mandolin they may be more than mando needs they sound great good quality case wouldn check luggage when flying small so bring carry ll protect your mando just fine
901	 these strings great string started using coated strings all guitars last year gotten use smooth feel string little harder fingers so coating nice they sound bright clean any uncoated string used think they will last longer which nice because really much fun restring stuff great leaves board clean fast no residue no sticky no oil film price right if use any fingerboard treatment try one these amazing m an intermediate player been last years tend sweaty hands loose grip every other pick used has turned fingers loose grip little sweat slick finish ok now thin med heavy can choose stiffness just by where hold pick incredible how stiffness will change depending where hold can even hold onto very nice grip these keep getting more cuz everytime hand one someone try last time see just hit add cart won be sorry second clip tuner bought much better than other brand easy use see colors swivel head make one favorite built tap metronome cool idea if re shopping tuner give try at less than fantastic buy just thought would throw another star review which based cost vs quality factor several guitars always thought epiphone be an inferior well was dead wrong may price tag better guitars sure has playability sound especially tag great beginners or seasoned player add his collection simple yet killer sound single humbucker hard beat will shy away from epiphone anymore don make mistake picking up only because stamped gibson several these tuners one great all others easy quick no reason be out tune these tuners white great no matter what color they they quality product rock

903	 easy mount solid grip only detractor would be at least hangs kind far from wall obviously factor what hang from though an acoustic would clear wall nicely solid body electric sits few inches away from wall silicone coating forks retaining bands get good grip without marring even soft wood very much prefer having one accident waiting happen stands floor bought first just anything hang from does job nothing at all fancy about strap two faux leather ends some nylon web triglide will do job until find one your dreams got tune without relying rocksmith ps3 double check against pretty crappy ear so rely tune correctly responds fast display incredible wish car dash looked like thing fits easily headstock front or behind tunes by sensing vibration instrument using microphone so can tune even if noisy any pedals effects amps etc setup do affect tone tuning actual resonance string even picks up well enough me adjust intonation well forced friend who just bought bass get one too price would recommend anyone who plays stringed instrument get one
904	 thing amazing like many cannot afford tube amp transforms solid state amps into something very comparable tube amps played years ago sustain harmonics insane preamp very precise allows nice variety tones unit very heavy rugged only component would be concerned over time battery adapter replaceable at low cost ok price tuners old style sealed pup plate mal adjusted off quite bit d suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions positive action intonation good better than expected much better than most chinese guitars at same price level however ve purchased others higher quality hardware same or less said ll probably do ok epiphone setup overall quality better than squier big disappointment ve been so impressed by epiphone one didn do quality manufacture assembly great pickups far less than inspiring yes great platform was so expecting those p90 sound may received one hundred lemons so many commented positively just didn tone bite was expecting could certainly invest some pup too many great p90 guitars bother roll dice guess

962	 know many people love design find much too frustrating be very careful putting fret correctly then snap then turn turn screw oops don let snap off again fall off while trying turn screw then go through whole routine again take off move another fret put again what farce worst capo ve owned ve tried nearly every brand type yeah ve had people show me how do right know do right just wrong spend so much time slipping snapping screwing screwing off having fall off forget garbage me also while m getting callouses worked out playing two hours every day last thing want pinch fingers against metal trying turn screw actually slightly painful fingers momentarily why deal work design seems like was non player who came up only good thing can say about looks durable no thanks most time am able use g7 capo one hand when moving adjusting clamping place however sometimes use both hands squeeze place so strings don buzz may seem like such big deal prefer an easier one work small hands an old carpal injury so prefer little strain possible place capo one better than any clasping kinds keysers etc respect after couple playing sessions figured out how best use capo just one hand most time now ve learned how best use ll keep when first got was upset had use hands forcible squeezing put place now ve learned how work better so can do most one hand without too much strain capo should be easy remove put stay tune hurt hands no handed squeezing interfere playing when inserted shouldn break too soon at least several months year before breaking if at all plus side unit seems pretty well made so should last long time think meets all criteria except having squeeze tight periodically ve tried so many capos now only ones liked were planet waves screw tops they easy use easy move from fret fret light hands stay tune out way they break damp california weather ve had them break me within couple months they snap go airborn which dangerous next ll try dunlop victor capos they screw tops similar style planet waves dunlop also makes planet waves capos they made more durable bronze so they should last longer hope those will be best me also ordered an aluminum version planet waves hopes won break like their thermoplastic ones do if small hands like me don want strain hands while playing like me then rules out kysers any squeezing type capos shubs fall off hassle all around take off adjust springtop ones suspect well why like screwtops don get way easy adjust ok hope dunlop victor will do job me now ll try next m giving one stars caveat must get silver aluminum one otherwise black thermoplastic ones do break thermoplastic ones broke me within months use different ones until got silver one which has had problem every music store go locally has black thermoplastic ones they look disbelief at me when say they break they did if leave fret or minutes go into kitchen make tea thing literally snaps breaks into or pieces goes airborne at high speed pieces could poke someone eye out public performance freaky there something about rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure or temperature fluctuation does live northern california so don know if dry climate like southwest would problem silver aluminum one by contrast hasn broken now nearly year use shows no hints doing feels different hand from thermoplastic no hint plastic very light heavy like g7 ones made sure order silver aluminum one through amazon since description black ones say some aluminum some thermoplastic only want make sure get aluminum one silver aluminum planet waves capo really best capo ve ever had super easy use very easy put switch from one fret another while re going from playing one song another don move your body or like do all other capos put or move which spectacular design keeps strings tune better than most other capos out way your hands doesn interfere when play any chord screw adjustment perfect place least strain doesn hurt fingers when turning least obtrusive best capo ever ll also add an old carpal injury so want least strain small hands so want least awkward most light capo does absolutely love m glad aluminum ones durable love capo let me tell about capo journey where ve used every brand while searching one first always owned old dunlop toggle action capo which just old tech know where just bundle synthetic cotton fiber kind one used use before had go back when first planet waves black thermoplastic capo broke don buy those if live damp climate like ca each one bought broke one broke within week during winter rainy days so loved those capos they were perfect was done breaking so figured d try others instead despite love planet waves design didn know about silver aluminum one yet well hated each other one tried kyser if had carpal or small handed know what mean don want capo involves squeezing really hard so your hands pain then don want play really hate kysers know some folks love squeeze use them fine different strokes right then tried schub be kidding me omg thing so ridiculous pops off wiggles about tricky hate now know many folks schub fans who give me drive by downrate m saying isn great those who love if love schub love unconditionally respect all m saying design me many other folks like me there other models fail similarly these they make squeeze so hard does hurt those like myself sensitive hands like g7 did fall love until maybe 5th squeezing then hurt your hand by unsqueezing apart put back awk ward painful sorry be such softie crybaby if carpal know what mean want go easy hands arms brutalize them other thing ve always hated about kysers again may be smaller physique involved how gets way so chording capo lot harder just dumb kyser lovers either accept challenge or don mind or claim doesn do know what m talking about ok so then because all broken planet waves thermoplastic capos turned next dunlop turnscrew models liked them they very similar pw design screw location more awkward use turning their screws lot harder fingers got ripped pained fingertips show so turned back search better planet waves model right here silver one excellent made aluminum thermoplastic bought one has lasted me almost years now without single problem by now contrast would run through or thermoplastic ones want say if performing public venue never use thermoplastic ones because thermoplastic ones dramatically burst flew across room could easily poke someone eyes out kidding don use those public situations back excellent aluminum silver pwaves capo love because doesn break at all has all great thermoplastic model features make best capo ever especially us sensitive folks carpal or small handed people etc great features ease use easy fitting perfect best all capos capo fits so easily simply put fretboard location screw perfect never move or your hand more than couple inches unlike other screwtops or all other capos there no need any moving around adjusting falling down due balance issues then chasing falling sheesh none nonsense put they ve engineered brilliantly so can easily get move from fret fret put where want screw great ease wow best ever category ease use tops ever will never hurt only helps weighs nothing easy carry can slip onto peg area just so light still can believe how light feels does what supposed other capos don do no issues being tune just screw level tightness desire no wrestling around like some capos do screw most easy location screw itself nicely made so doesn hurt your fingers at all when screw unscrew breeze no problems size so small doesn get your way fretboard won do hand yoga order play capo d songs flat know what concept capo should always be flat out your way so can play chords pretzeled twister instead chords now play capo d songs all time because capo so much fun musically whole new magical experience truth ve found good equipment matters music making never played acoustic well or much until got first applause great action yamaha love now since applause necks break both guitars taught me good equipment easy use case guitars great action imperative case capos ease use no pain produced imperative opens up world capo use magic mathematics music theory if love other brands don diss me know perfect m happy works perfectly because when best one will shine your music will enjoy listening play those who sensitive or small hands or carpal know what m talking about won settle torture kysers schubs gotta be kidding me bought every capo imaginable need garage sale get rid pile ended up was using old toggle type again instead until found aluminum silver planet waves capo planet waves has made perfect capo now no more issues just easy fun playing capo d songs again only buy silver model because when if get silver guaranteed get aluminum thermoplastic d been shopping music stand at local music stores all them at cheapest price type solid backside plus tax item including shipping cost me only about here from amazon seller musician friend sent promptly got within business days without any problems had no trouble putting stand together without any instructions bolts aren easy adjust compared perhaps more expensive stand don care about hard adjust most time at certain height so no need fiddle during group performance did need be adjusted different people was ok could be smoother if re someone who needs fiddle stand height constantly might want get higher priced one makes easier if only occasionally going adjust height no big deal other than solid handy stand meets expectations does what should price off retail excellent m completely satisfied
963	 best capo ve ever owned little awkward doesn just clip headstock one hand takes me two hands also put having retune string makes all worthwhile like choice colors too works just stated now can plug mic either way gives me more versitility these wonderful strings acoustic playing they great sound finger picking even pick they still sound good stand after finally figured out how attach so didn interfere boom mic stand works okay due its heaviness does hold good size amount music however short width wise so can really get an open notebook stay place at least mic boom there heavy travel also so don know how much ll use

1002	 very sturdy stand suitable stage use stand even accommodates double neck its very compact when folded m still giving stars bought bag these various picks just throw around our practice studio most band members don mind them its great picks lying all over place so can grab one during takes recommended stand ok light home use would recommend thing gigging or travel very cheaply made does job guitars do rest naturally sweet spot must set down correct position or will lay bit sideways jar other guitars rack avoid if can spend more beware tuner works by vibration if your playing loud other people ll ask them stop playing so can tune recommended band environments probably ok solo gigs or home practice otherwise its very stealth easily clips most guitars
1003	 piece plastic just terrible d be better off couple books towel recommended these best strings around last long time especially if live near beach where corrosion always concern wish discovered these years ago comfortable grip works wonders nice clear tones pick tips thanks

1009	 so am big fan sm57 microphone vocal mic due its ease recording good sound quality bunch large style condenser microphones rode nt1 at2020 sp c they clear so sensitive difficult get solid performance mix without them either clipping or picking up everything room so if re like me andlike let go bit when sing should try dynamic mic wide range forgiveness they can giveyou when belt little did an b test against sm7b just bought sm57 love vocals exact same processing chain cable settings etc just switched mics out sung same passage well say sm57 sounds muddy comparison sm7b if didn new microphone would still like sm57 genni out bottle now so going back sm7b clear sounds sweet comparison still handles vocal sound dynamics very well dynamic singers rock jazz gospel opera if budget get sm7b if don buy sm57 until do budget quiet singers acoustic folk if sing softly all time really don need one these dynamic mics would be better off standard large condenser mics listed above those type like studio projects c best think they close very nice microphone money general voice over work would use mic professional singing just spoken word many microphones compares range mics am no audio file these do job like colors did buy some more expensive magami ones can tell difference
1010	 what need know about mic mic very directional must keep your mouth sweet spot at all times best results pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory an inch too close makes strong proximity effect found palm width from tip mic works best long keep mouth there results predictable good regardless room m also if mic aimed too low your face like at lower lip or chin ll sound like stuffy nose aimed too high like at bridge nose sounds sneering nasal right at upper lip works well me bass cut presence boost convenient use plastic thing like pick switch them metal will scratch ve played around switches end both set flat was best initially thought presence boost was good idea mix made vocals too honky upper mids flat where at flat sounds most natural being dynamic won sound open airy condenser might though takes eq well can eq if remove foam use pop filter do get more highs after working while realized doesn always sound right seems unbalance highs above 5k toward sibilance little too much might work after using few years learned starting bad mix too bright or blaring then adding sm7b vocals causes mic appear dull muffled really mix problem whereas if start vocal sound make clear natural build mix around mix turns out natural sound too bright or dull either yes rejects room sounds more than condenser gobsmacked amazingly so rejects what behind side front pretty sensitive so if re singing an echoey room behind will pick up so don think will make sound like re dead control room unless actually one hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind re set being records about twice dry condenser takes reverb pretty well mix meaning can add reverb delay without having your vocals drop too far away undefined mix so what does sound like sound very natural true voice truly vocal mic first foremost plus dry up close characteristic mic top selling points works fantastically death metal growls clean singing atop sparse acoustic clean backgrounds does slight color mids agree frequency response chart indicating has slight scoop 900hz slight boost 2000hz still natural sounding despite color tailored voice reduce honky boxy mids accentuate main vocal intelligibility range one reason why mic considered flattering vocals still has body though definitely thin sounding mic thing heavy rugged capsule surrounded by truncated cone like metal screen enclosed all sides screen like kind see behind microwave oven doors what like about mic can throw inside bubble mailer or wrap scarf storage worry about crushing or damaging doesn need big case like some condensers especially tube mics do so actually compact practice quick set up one those detachable mic adapter mounts even without adapter has convenient free rotating collar screw onto mount stand so can hold mic place while screwing down mic needs db gain loud singing 60db quiet singing 70db whispering make sure your preamp designed at least 60db clean gain some cheaper usb interfaces only go up 35db if your interface lacks juice no worries get yourself cloudlifter ll add 25db nice clean gain phantom powered too overall would prefer condenser good room since allows me move little more without coloring sound because has more openness air compared one since room isn perfect will do biggest pros natural sounding even reverb delay stands out mix especially good spoken voice was designed since unlike condenser sm7b does very good job picking up many mouth clicks mouth noises background hissing end if had get rid all mics keep only one vocals rest life would be sm7b mainly because know can conveniently use anywhere anytime get reliable good results edit forgot say when listen mic shoot outs net often times tip sm7b will be positioned same distance condenser problem because sm7b diaphragm actually back few inches so condensers will be closer talent or lack talent than sm7b such cases causing latter sound more duck ish honky un detailed or thin due solely distance factors thus characteristic intrinsic mic color shoot outs where proper distance was used d be surprised how much sm7b sounds like good condenser really does course may be missing air or conversely be less prone sibilance said below can easily eq since mic takes eq very well seriously 2db shelf highs another thing wanted add gentle bump 1k 2k region vocal definition his mic has can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending some sources again can eq down bit finally when shure says mic has flat response true has color frequency response charts show yet color gives larger than life natural sound voice so sounds natural even though completely transparent honest after tons experimenting settled exl116 d standard e flat standard ve tried top little too floppy d makes notes sound out tune if don press string just right also tried while gives real solid full rhythm tone attack too rounded due pick taking longer travel over wider string reduces articulation so while get fuller sound get more dynamics attack latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier can eq fullness into rhythm track can add pick attack greater dynamics tension wise at d standard ideal doable sound wise has been best metal recordings why m sticking exl116 set from now also replaced g string gauge wound better sounding power chords compared ernie balls d addarios start off less bright maintain their brightness longer thus more even predictable response over time ve been jazz iii fan since starting red too buttery rounded sounding then moving black durable bit tubby sounding eventually tried 0mm tortex pick which had good attack was somewhat mushy sounding through amp sims then tried 60mm holy cow sound change was like getting new pick ups more mids more attack faster attack scratchier attack less lows now d think would make your sound thin indeed sounds thinner also clearer by factor two thus when recording through amp sims get clearer more dynamic more attack ish sound when using 0mm fundamental was bit too strong which made mushy amp sim sound 60mm did trick just sounds heavier tighter more articulate while does wear faster recording purposes current ultimate pick choice so if your doesn sound clear articulate or aggressive enough first give pack picks shot don take word da nehh nan ve owned these several years found them sufficient mixing purposes so long keep using reference songs comparison because by themselves ath m50 don flat frequency response they re flatter than most phones under hundred will find they re bit too middy lacking lower treble regions compared good set studio monitors fortunately found deficiency can be fixed corrective eq curve load up parametric eq do following 1db 80hz q 5db 350hz q db 1khz q 1db 3khz q 2db 5khz q 5db 15khz q save preset if listen reference songs ll find more pleasing balanced 3d kind sound compared original base correction curve published frequency response graphs ath m50 proof worked now these headphones sound lot like good studio monitors they translate better correction curve active bass these solid seems go down 20hz or so more felt than heard subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound where these headphones better than studio monitors unless well treated room good sub therefore use these headphones adjust bass relation reference songs also use them editing slight sounds pops clicks getting reverb tails right help panning tracks they very good like magnifying glass foam pads black paint headband will crack fall off after years wrapped black sports tape around headband works well replacement pads can be bought amazon so padding material coating could been better made plus middy frequency response why give stars instead still think they re best headphones mixing tracking under couple hundred well made tube good amount gain highs excellent cleans crunch due increased clarity high gain metal however found bit too hairy instance v1 position preamp had little too much trebly sizzle versus other tubes comparison sovtek has less hair tighter sounding also has more an upper mid range fizz which can get annoying end switched tung sol ruby ac7 which was formerly v2 overdrive position got me better articulation less fizz so ruby ac7 v1 tung sol v2 been best combo so far one pedal can do without can sculpt your tone before hits your amp key getting tight rhythm tone at high gain so if encounter an amp isn tight enough or high gain distortion doesn sound good by itself just turn down gain or use lower gain channel then hit hard pedal sounds so much better than internal high gain distortion alright so here some things might want know before buy gain knob when turned zero still produces overdrive so can use clean boost pedal high output humbuckers still get some mild tube like overdrive at zero gain isn advertised clean boost pedal so how much gain distortion does pedal if re going into clean channel an amp plenty classic rock blues enough metal though if crank gain high knob all way can just barely get prog style metal tone distortion pedal just an overdrive thing uses tiny smc components circuitry therefore isn really moddable unlike bad monkey doesn an additional mixer cabinet emulated output like tube screamer boosts mids reduces bass so going into mushy sounding tube channel get tighter distorted sound anyone who has nice warm amp gets pedal thinking they ll get more same may be disappointed what they need instead transparent clean boost pedal keeps their same tone just louder volume classic modified switch pretty cool two guitars one kind bassy scooped sounding other bright middy well using switch can make one come out more equivalent other when needed keeps me from adjusting amp each time switch guitars classic slightly lower gain more mid boosted sound quite tight think peavey eq structure modified more scooped saturated think mesa eq structure so switch useful little bonus eats batteries sucking around ma at 9v so mah rechargeable lasts hrs swear if blue led weren so bright would probably get an extra hour instead getting an adapter got an battery aa clip 9v battery clip 12v dc plug sanyo eneloop batteries hooked up negative tip positive sleeve now mah monster about hours play time pedal perfect get what advertised do rugged looks good haven found be noisy at all unless there was something wrong strings grounded through bridge etc someone mentioned silver tops dials falling off if they were decals looked knobs seem like all one solid piece me another thing found instead using an overdrive plugin daw if use real overdrive pedal front interface magically makes all hum noise from pickups go away overall yes highly recommend would suggest people check out hardwire metal distortion if they want something standalone rather than an overdrive into crunchy amp like others though can stop playing through great purchase especially if bought used

1024	 simple enough right works advertised great simple idea m glad someone put into production taste loop too long where wraps around at headstock nut area so just tied up snug had been using martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto plastic button far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off button martin holder however folks brand new shiny expensive guitars might want take note while nylon lace wraps around nice strong fairly rough abrasive experience will very definitely wear at finish your git area won rub finish off or anything degree if re freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection your which am will definitely notice finish rubbed dulled even chipped bit there at points contact can think million simple solutions another story overall great little item ok was cheap nine bucks at time design looked good sensible seemed perfect solution real need bought without hesitation however once hooked up was very surprised how flimsy gooseneck light condenser mic small shock mount at slightest movement mic stand attachment flaps up down like crazy will continue way something like minute if stopped by hand obviously any small bump into stand will once again set off using at home ve gotten away touching stand while recording by being very careful obviously unit far from ideal since then ve gotten another sidemount boom from same brand though haven really put through its paces yet other unit rock solid far more adjustable reliable only costs few bucks more stage msa9508 posi lok sidemount boom anyone considering product highly recommend bypassing one forking out just few more bucks stage msa9508 posi lok sidemount boom will be far far happier cheers wanted like really did idea an amp portable cheap just made me think perfect however unit received was cr p m going assume was defective blanket all positive reviews dispersions one got kept cutting out might be playing solo line might hear about notes or something when holding chord sustained sound would cut out after few seconds frustrating did weigh whether or try replacement unit so so sound overall quality however didn compel me give another go bummer any suggestions an amp similar size portability cheers case re wondering about difference between hohner harmonica holder hohners costing more than twice one price one made china while others made germany now m definitely one those who automatically dismiss quality chinese made products fact many musical items surprisingly good quality made there item however has some good some more stereotypical problems chinese goods pros cheap sturdy unlike some reviewers love taller height far far better ergonomically having stoop scrunch your neck windpipe also like tighter springs though does take little getting used secure feel your harp worth slight extra effort now cons true what others said plastic neck tube smells bad some said an annoying chemical smell definitely noticeable cut off got big wide replacement tube at tap plastics buck make sure one get wide enough slide over bends neck loop bar thingee got diameter 2nd perhaps bigger problem metal bent evenly mine was distinctly taller one side than other neck loop was way off did best bend all parts even flat metal part tough shape reason didn return figure most them equally uneven just picture bunch poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand little or no machine help ensure consistency work did myself works fine now fairly even like said taller height just about right me just annoying some most basic expectations aren met like holding your harmonica at an even height both sides all said bottom line prefer using over german made hohner holder because better ergonomically taller holds harp more securely traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better less effort than nouveau single butterfly nut design more expensive german hohner knowing what know its drawbacks m still tempted pick up another back up or spare great deal if re willing do little work hi folks ok thing cheap cool cheap item can use money thrown away before buying had read various reviews some folks liking others saying too small well want clear up once all too small specifically too short reach across all six strings if go past third fret or so depending your doesn open wide enough be able be slid down past third fret even skinny neck thing really puzzler mean who hell would make capos size especially when they could ve made capos actually fit same production price sold them at same price someone somewhere just plain ass stupid however positive from whole mess finally found capo use ukulele way cheap ha ha if looking capo any size utter garbage cheers soooo bummed simply love sound these cans speakers just too dang close surface deep enough cups press down hard ears max time can wear them like an hour then can wear them day or so due residual pain guess if they used thicker pads deepen cups might help also most other phones speaker areas fairly flat surfaces while one has speakers jutting out cups covered by just one thin nylon sheet so kind like double trouble however these really do great sound especially tight bass clarity if weren discomfort factor would be using them all time now hardly use them at all fact when first tested these out was ready hop computer order couple more m glad waited really give them more prolonged test course we all varying shapes sizes ha ha so they might work where they don me if so ve got bargain some great cans if ouch cheers

1027	 think pedal good value an overdrive pedal its speaker simulated 2nd output makes great value stand alone preamp plugged into daw listened krks was impressed by its sound overdrive quite good no can hold candle j rockett pedals alan holdsworth signature overdrive at an absurdly good buy share another reviewer opinion about pedal being comfortable at certain treadle angles however because there very little output those lower positions don find be an issue fact rarely feel need use full travel treadle when doing volume swells thought bit strange thing specifies volt ac adapter yet can be powered by volt battery so decided see if would any issues if used one spot ac adapter polarity corrected course worked just fine usually power looper same adapter so built splitter cable labeled polarity specific terminations everything worked fine curiosity didn end there though wanted know if there would be any discernible difference if used volt power supply did only difference could find was power indicator led was just wee bit dimmer using volt adapter there was no change sonics whatsoever nor was there reduction output volume could hear so what up volt adapter spec behringer did think could fool all us out here give four stars because even though don use pedal full sweep just very comfortable those lower positions ll probably get used eventually eminence patriot cannabis rex probably smoothest sounding speaker ve ever heard period does mean dull sounding or muffled at least if hearing still good hesitated quite bit before decided buy install fender mustang ii worries were naught incredibly tamed icepick highs without losing shimmer clarity clean sounds yet overdrive sounds there very little fuzziness just big full fat sound articulate without being buzzy if play metal ll probably hate speaker if like bluesy classic rock jazzy sounds speaker seriously consider turned mustang ii into an open back combo cannabis rex gave amp low end extension needed had turn treble control up bit more unlike most amps never got shrill or piercing just buttery smooth clear also much more efficient than stock speaker at 102db 1w 1m don know how eminence did love behringer has had somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so was bit apprehensive about buying unit so far so good mic preamps sound pretty good clean relatively quiet knobs slider feel smooth well made also seems send hotter signal jbl eon 510s good thing built effects probably its weakest point ve heard some really cheap digital reverbs much smoother than unit also wish control room knob outputs were independent main output slider would definitely make lot more practical then again would also turn into buss mixer so all all too shabby mixer probably wouldn use recording ve just received mustang spent an hour playing fuse software thing outrageous practice amp ve never heard anything like its price class size good instrument mic decent monitoring system think could probably gig thing one feature fuse software no one seems mention ability add an overdrive or compressor module post gain after preamp an incredibly useful tool controlling overdrive characteristics amp models effect fender has given amp ability emulate power section saturation overdrive module sounds very different much mellower post gain than pre gain before preamp like normal stomp box don know any other dedicated modelers do except maybe axe fx costs about times more power section saturation highly desirable reason why we re seeing lot very low power tube amps like fender champion bugera v5 these days their problem they re pretty much useless clean sounds at louder volumes they don enough power so they re really only good overdriven sounds so mustang think fender has hit perfect combination flexibility simplicity one package thing sounds way bigger than looks way better than its price would suggest has classic fender sound feel many different fender amps without weight cost tube replacement needs what like well just got plugged here some initial impressions pretty much what expected much more relaxed at higher volumes than m1 definitely much bigger fuller sounding its commensurate drawbacks slightly less naturally sparkly compared m1 will reduce mids bit via fuse editor although has less overall sparkle also translates smoother highs was actually bit hard pressed get sound buzzy course via front panel only m sure can be done using fuse editor supposed be lbs heavier than m1 sure doesn feel like keep looking at m1 fiendishly wondering if there way shoehorn speaker there most part patches created m1 translated pretty well after required firmware update needing just few adjustments here there m appreciative fuller more naturally extended low end won crank bass control much m1 course translates more headroom power amp more from editing via fuse here few things found liked deluxe model sounds better deluxe cab vice versa has more headroom works great clean spanky amp cab while model propensity break up sooner works better less sparkly cab also seems more low end girth twin bit too icepick y sometimes seems pair better bassman cab supersonic cab bit more muted at top end than any other cabs works well sounds use bit more gain good keeping things from getting too buzzy very fat sounding cab sim both m1 seem respond really well tex mex pickups played regular sized humbuckers these amps yet other has mini humbuckers somehow get feeling won like much do strat think understandable though since fender has always been all about single coils m

1063	 used these strings since they first came out d addario make best strings out there am sure there others who do good job can actually hear difference doesn really matter which buy they all sound different better isn sad when somebody produces great product screws up description product great value money worth while buying if no other reason than save money overpriced dc power units from manufacturers pedal units trouble they do say whether or cables come unit they don dumb them all they needed say was needed buy them separately which later did seems like nit picking well live abroad these things take long while come down me sloppy isn cheapest most effective way saving lot money wasted 9v batteries will always run out gig rather than when doesn matter linked power supply which still cheaper than any 9v ones supplied by manufacturer been golding up an strat plus has seen better days wiith gold pick guard tuning pegs jack plate looks like custom shop job finished hard work am delighted appearance goods up scratch fit properly good service product packing delivery time recommend them last amplifier purchased was fender twin valve some years ago difficult use small apartment too loud so after giving up trying use volume at searched smaller thing amp looked suspiciously cheap although reviews were great still was concerned whether would be good enough arrived got into realizing went web downloading presets all kinds features including recording was really mind blowing thing built sounds effects better than many effect pedals no longer use zoom setting emulate twin reverb effects used lightly am amazed at both quality practise amp recommend anybody who wants huge bang their buck may experienced problems musicians drummer drunk rhythm late need rehearse gets job done can lay down rhythm lines drum lines get sound want thing remember whatever effect using lead will kick any recording playback they use same input jack otherwise easy great product best if playing really poor lead work nobody can hear lol
1064	 always used another company strings avoided ernie ball strings now don know why after using these am very happy quality tone get from each set most ve ever spent strap say well worth price very comfortable looks great too

1066	 been using brand several different gauges many years continueto do so get long life very good clarity from d addarios bought these spares also use other amps so swap back forth like right angle plug end input fits std telecaster input jack great flexibility cable itself another thing liked these do tangle use androll up easily storage more expensive cables rather use these speaker has very clear full range sound brown deluxe am very good way reminds me bit jbl smooth depth clarity if want little ray charles raspcan get from amp speaker pick attack cool speaker nice addition nice bag great features slightly large telecaster or stratocaster works fine either actually swapped another bag putting les paul jr one tele gibson bag thegibson bag was really tight fit lp jr headstock great unit price offer lot variations echo delay types sturdy enough use stage piece even so would nothesitate use way can say what battery life only use withan ac adapter em600 sounds great using outputs differentamps drive mine sometimes behringer b box using one ofthe pre amp gain controls or behringer tube amp modeler only downside settings type control echo delay types bithard read without getting close especially dim lighting isn really big deal though often don put em600 floor can put electric guitars gig bags stand solid no problems months use assembly was pretty easy took little time
1067	 folks ve tried them all from dean markley ernie ball all their good bad points after years playing d addario still makes best electric strings money although prefer super light top regular bottom version always loved feel tone durability d addario strings ve been using d addario strings years great satisfaction these flex steels excellent bass tones response resonance superior ear can go wrong these guys used d addario electric strings years always loved their feel playability tone reliability set no exception light gauge those who like shred little more still great tone highly recommend anything by d addario m d addario man myself hey free free so jumped at chance try these strings out thus far they proven durable both terms playability longevity tone so many other variables consider when rating strings such they go gauge string being used playing style climate end user etc these solid performing string set though am unlikely switch allegiances from d addario any time soon still there no reason fear trying these elixir out
1068	 been purchasing these strings over years now only string allow touch electric guitars great microfiber polishing cloth great price paid less than half through amazon comgreat product works very well nitro finishes best strap available price excellent quality very comfy love pick pocket will be buying more great price picks spanning from light heavy picks good quality would recommend anyone looking picks
1069	 these bright sounding strings easy play hold up well rarely break one favorite strings les paul tend go ernie ball super slinky strat these would probably sound nice strat well ok like one lot stays instrument allows quick tune up at anytime accurate easy see use does get way while playing sure beats other units used where clamp some weird thing tune up then stash back your gig bag one bing tune back playing weighs next nothing so do even notice unless tuning up like capo because goes quickly there no pulling strings out tune bit large one cases still makes there ok seems well made so am worried will break or need replacing long time one nicer capo ive used certainly superior old school band based jobs from one nicest features can be clipped head while use then can quickly grab position release go heck could probably place mid song if were so inclined do so also clamps without bending strings ve used start les paul martin all no complaints hardly ever use capo if need one am glad one
1070	 ve been using these strings guitars last years they always give me consistent results consider them one greatest bargains out there ve been using schaller strap locks guitars since they give me sense security knowing strap totally secured consider cheap insurance love capo electric can adjust tension any position neck very easily tried other more expensive capos one winner ve been playing since so ve gone through plenty stands always found hanging type be safest most secure long time was using hamilton chrome hanging stand when first saw these being used by all players at church attend christ community church st charles il decided give them look build quality very good all sections come contact electric or acoustic padded foam material prevent scratching denting offers very solid support feel safe putting only type stand prefer use do wish wasn made china too much our money goes country just opinion bottom line am very happy stand would recommend any player who wants sturdy well built stand keeps safe should last ever
1071	 didn give stars just because know there better strings out there these strings great value wouldn hesitate buy them again fact already bought them several times one little thing appreciate about these strings different colored ends makes them easy identify really like tuner convenience ease use however broke too long after bought one connections broke think they might made little more durable since then moreover sent they replaced so was cool would be nice though had do just got them bought put them up so don know about longevity so far though they work great seem be sturdy enough price great am using them variety instruments including steel string acoustic classical acoustic electric electric bass string mandolin hangers adjust easily while maintaining stability
1072	 d addario sets good stuff got turned onto them about decade ago by coworker color coded ends great whether new at changing strings or just want more automated if an old veteran stretching they stay tune fine unknown truth about non nylon strings maybe even them too there only handful string makers d addario actually makes them other companies gore uses them their elixir series just adds polyweb coating also use ghs standard sets they good too faves ernie ball sets they rarely go sale don remember who makes what strings what companies though offshore production standard thing now no telling where they actually come from anyways doubt gfs strings domestic production instance was bought based advice others had cable standard neutrik switchcraft type ends fail me cable was supposed be either strain free or simply designed long life because strain usage worked great about months then broke happened so quickly trad types seem take longer swore must been output jack after confirming was okay tried shorter cable which worked fine d addario does offer lifetime replacement puts bit bind need backup cable while waiting replacement pay return shipping defective cable out pocket also get r taken altogether makes deal breaker extra costs essentially make cable expensive something has track record lasting years case bit bullet did what should done first go round got really nice dimarzio cable again cable sounds good while works capacitance longer cables can be an issue good news imo high price guarantee any cable sounding good replacement dimarzio another example one was at top list cable comparisons don get into mojo or intangible aspects will typically find someone paying much more cable want durability published capacitance within certain range one meets half those criteria gets expensive because potential fail sooner rather than later well expensive relative cable an initially higher price longer lifespan so replacement planet waves sent me now backup still original packaging figure ll use only short periods while replacing main cable so should last long time situation if few shipping d addario still honoring lifetime warranty if when 2nd one breaks may get replaced more likely will just chalk up learning lesson toss even shipping decent percentage cost more durable cable imo should be set aside fund its eventual replacement if cable would last years d probably give stars given price if d addario took away warranty thing would probably re shape customer perception what something at price should cost because wear item plain simple idk how much r d worth their trouble put something at price point what would shoot realistically acceptable period trouble free use w no warranty trade off would make deal breaker those don know pedal copy more expensive line echo park two things make better than real deal lower price imo better tap tempo do an odd sort clicking sequence echo park echo machine simply hold down footswitch seconds then set your tap tempo when re satisfied just hold again enter regular off mode foolproof some folks will point superior construction echo park won totally deny said effects modules construction behringer pedals basically same plastic where d like metal surface mount construction practical maintenance really only possible by manufacturer again there switch tone dock requires maintenance at some point if can be cleaned up dock becomes paperweight best can tell all other settings same between copy original makes sense saves behringer costs any r d they just had make fit dimensions their enclosures alter tap tempo algorithm access win customer because decreases price those who find moral dilemma buying copy something else d submit most what your pedal collection has probably been either partly or wholly copied from something else unless want restrict yourself known originals prices they fetch oftentimes standard option if there worthy improvement imo practical sense usually more than sonic one would kind behoove insist original tap tempo em600 earns its purchase just like lower noise floor biyang compress x earns purchase over what copies venerable mxr dyna comp so why only stars because way street cost cutting means pedal will potentially be something landfill years come there no denying get stars requires unsurpassed durability at any price point despite what may think can be done flipside an ever so slightly higher cost behringer probably decided they preferred increased profit per unit instead or didn want go above certain price point risk getting beat by direct competitors other big reason knock star off little amp crank get acceptable volumes from there quite bit audible hiss from pedal if all used were bigger amps would never noticed wouldn been an issue at all 21st century time lower playing volumes live settings which means smaller amps more popular so hiss could absolutely be deal breaker might be slightly lower than p re using wouldn be so sure d say d want true watt amp ensure isn an issue may be absolute overkill gigs play aggravations really small ones overall pedal works fine through any amp ve tried some kind picky especially delay pedals ve typically found digital delay work better drive od distortion pedals opposed analog delay pedal no different much like mxr carbon copy bbe two timer they aren nearly flexible one imo par flexibility old boss dd dd or danelectro dan echo surpasses them all different types delay effects many those something would never use could imagine how others would absolutely love them or they could come handy something specific or be great flexibility recording studio also worth considering at em600 price could buy backup or 2nd one different settings pretty cool knock off schaller trem or diaz tremodillo 2nd or 3rd joyo pedal favorite thus far don care cheap jacks get what pay can always replace them if they break work pedals all time ve got scratchbuilt improved ea trem two footswitchable speeds cheap little danelectro tuna melt other than crummy bypass plastic construction tuna melt favorite since has hard soft switch improved ea has great preamp guaranteed unity gain or more footswitchable speeds added gives extra flexibility think joyo trumps by just little bit core trem sound nice blend tuna melt hard soft settings so part really subjective take flavor trem suffice say if ve tried few one will probably satisfy at least bit no unity gain issues speed depth good sweep throughout their ranges just niggle how hard would be get word tremolo silkscreened so centered box at least there no skull flames like high gain distortion yet install neck purchased enough necks over years really good idea what expect there little no evidence corners being cut just start materials labor all look good great measuring fit specifications money having mounting screw holes drilled actually plus most econo necks seem be off by at least d rather trouble drilling them from scratch than having plug them dowels re drill frets look good nut looks good until can install can only really vouch stars long story short neck looks better than many ve had cost 2x much or more unless has twist or hump actually earns 5th star even if frets need little cleanup still earns 5th star while some may like flatter radius d argue makes easier get frets so they aren much an issue clearcoated maybe nice amber finish most more expensive necks may no finish at all so again another reason 5th star
1073	 they ok big fan tho they odd metal sound when play them had earnie ball previously might switch back or go dunlop witch put sting love probably won get these again ever use spider iv works great ve had about months no issues use working guitars mainly does job well pretty large very soft padded well anti static thing crap right out box had holes stitching all pockets were sown crooked what can expect tho was temporary solution don recommend long term use will probably fall apart only cost around so expectations weren very high begin right out box had hole stitching front pocket was sown crooked don plan keeping long

1099	 good cable money could better stress release certainly plenty good enough normal use very good value tried them all these best sounding book they last pretty long non coated strings play nicely too play fingernails just can control standard metal banjo style fingerpicks because can feel strings used alaska picks years which very good these better they give control nails yet tone protection metal can feel strings muting harmonics everything if play nails want finger picks these put gibson j did increase bass ok j strength ruined wonderful clarity balance these guitars also took off little finish sound hole when removed tried martin d nope bass got muddier which definitely wrong way go martin at point was going return finally tried small body now worked great louder focused projects much better almost resonator like fantastic slide or capo d high home now so an o port can help needs help small body or cheap sample made high end guitars sound worse if can afford better may be worth try be careful did chip off some finish at sound hole

faster easier overall really nice convenience upgrade guitars very expensive do fender uses these american deluxe once got one had these rest stratocasters because they save time restringing more inclined restring frequently which means sound better fresh strings can do lot your sound ve put these several guitars always appreciate them when changing strings at instalation be aware these staggered height tuners so be sure put them correct holes see below these drop replacement tuners most modern mia mim fender stratocasters telecasters use shaller style tuner fender makes these relatively cheap now chrome although wish they would make them affordable available gold finish ve seen also seen nickel black they make gold hard find rather expensive something like set function purposei think people believe these somehow give more stable tuning or something actually their purpose proper use traditional non locking tuner just stable some folks don actually understand how properly use traditional tuners they don get stable tuning result because they use too few or too many wraps don string correctly those folks these will elimiate resulting pings such their intended purpose speed string changes believe some folks confuse locking tuners locking nut respect locking nut quite definitely makes more stable tuning why always find them floyd rose tremolos which made dive bombing locking tuners really purpose fit installationregarding fit these little pins backside if considering replacement make sure get tuners right size configuration your so don drill back neck tuner bores headstock or use inserts if want use these don little alignment holes stewart macdonald makes small drilling jig drilling those holes expensive about expensive messing up your neck or breaking tuners when tighten them down ill fitting mounts nearly impossible drill those alignment pin holes correctly without jig even jig easy be slightly off these fit most newer fender stratocasters tele both american mim will be drop replacement no muss no fuss most those cases pull one your existing tuners out look at before change if squier or knockoff may want measure headstock bore remove tuner look at back mount maybe buy inspect knowledge might return them there usually an exact fit drop replacement locking tuner can replace your standard tuner so if isn look one same brand what your now be aware different tuners also slightly different holes bored main peg hole typical neck bores tuners by brand shown warmoth site at these holes warmoth uses custom necks when fitting tuners various brands fender shaller tuners its two step bore main portion being rest at vintage style tuners use gotoh grover use two step sperzel uses planet waves uses course if mechnically inclined tools don mind potentially drilling additional holes your neck can almost fit any tuner want any sometimes means using inserts or bushings or drilling hole tiny backmount screw or alignment pins different locations best answer use tuner drop replacement when installing be sure look at height pegs your old these new tuners these all same length they staggered heights long shorter think also seen some sets these put long ones e d string holes shorter ones g b highe holes summaryacoustic sounds ok noisy weird ways returned price seems high what vs alternatives marketplace pros boss case metal mechanical design durable standard 9v power power jack back where belongs variety acoustic sounds possible personally only thought them sounded realistic at all though cons fizzy noise integrated notes played or chords generally kind noisy pedal chain while several boss pedals think they always make knobs too small font print too small prefer pedals larger fewer knobs can be tweaked your toe if needed while playing details basic concept good had an ac prior model sold because had noise problem where there was fizzy noise when play note wasn between notes or when playing was integrated sound every note played or chord could filter was also just noisy pedal chain adjusting your volume down higher gain pickups helps some however sold model because didn want pedal chain everything else wasn happy sound at time ac were selling about new boss since redesigned raised price significantly ac bought ac hoping they had improved issues ac they did little enough keep returned after week because still has same basic issues just pronounced think ac could work gigging there other choices sound good instead tax or shipping so me boss pedal overpriced great opted behringer acoustic modeller instead they make two has reverb pedal opted got expect durability will be lower behringer than boss has plastic case however an effect pull out just once while since can buy or or behringers price boss if breaks ll just buy another also boss gt multi effects unit can get same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out out behringer or out boss ac least cost effective those choices ac has noise issues other two don m saying its bad pedal m just saying wasn best choice me when considering cost sounds usage model if they would fix noise issues might even kept did opt keep behringer those times m using discrete pedal board want an acoustic model effect boss pedal just didn work well me comparisons compared side by side following pedals fulltone mini deja vibe dunlop univibe discontinued stainless steel model dunlop roto vibe voodoo labs micro vibe bbe soul bender well comparing some different beasts modulation family an mxr phase mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato behringer time machine summary just factsa great pedal favorite uni vibe all doesn take lot space up standard power supply good visibility control knob settings does add or subtract frequencies signal or add noise only pedal univibe group can say about why almost certainly going be one keep might slightly less ability produce thick univibe effect some others still need play little more overall love pedal at under bucks only downsides see led does flash speed rate speed control top left which makes hard toe tweak right foot quality seems ok time will tell durability pros smallish form factor although slightly larger than boss pedal doesn take much more room than standard pedal standard power supply 9v center negative jack top back easy access way patch cables sides switchable between chorus univibe vibrato controls spaced well handling use knobs high visibility marking easy see best pro does boost or cut volume does boost or cut bass mids or lows just applies uni vibe type effect dialed retains character tone only pedal tested can say about most others cost times what one cost led red visible weird bright laser retina price at about bucks great deal quality construction metal case decent knobs pots switches no complaints so far cons led does flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right toe tweaking just had day so can tell might be limited getting deepest most lush univibe sound sure about will update review get time test further sounds great me overall highly recommended if want univibe don want do lot comparison shopping done some users report quality issues here guess time will tell mine works fine so far could buy still save money over most other options available notes other pedals compared fulltone mini deja vibe highest quality construction expected at large knob lower right corner speed great allows toe tweaking very useful vibe pedal complaint vibe colors tone boosts mid range tones while maintaining crisp highs slightly losing bass probably helps sound stand out mix however d rather vibe provide eq because when switch or off don want compensate at tone knobs try get back sound was able match exactly an authentic original uni vibe sound some adjusting seems kind muffle pick attack or compress also love hate relationship pedal after about week testing some days hate like build quality speed control originally liked was one only two pedals didn strip treble off tone until realized mids were boosted bass was cut pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag at shouldn be mxr dunlop m68 new at about new m68 uni vibe very good vibe pedal much like second place list pure sound might even like slightly better than jimi saying something perfect form factor shape size no significant coloration tone other than perhaps tiny boost treble one mode m68 gives jimi good run if extremely tight board space might be better choice they sound very similar m68 has wider range adjustment speed depth than jimi m sure extra range useful mxr jim dunlop mxr great factory customer service if ever an issue they fixed one pedals free even though out warranty really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack rear vertical surface instead right side vertical surface often way right angle plugs all other mxr use small top left push button switching from chorus vibe pedal was main negative issue d leave mini switch engaged red led burning all time looking like when was actually engaging circuit main switch was also tight fit pedal has level knob which m usually fan don see need effect didn care white main led much course power supply location led does pulse speed was annoying due white led subjective thing suppose all said great sounding option perfect mxr size so good choice still 2x cost jimi stuck jimi form function sound value dunlop uni vibe uv1 cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard see settings placement vintage switch back pedal was easily forgotten at worst awkward at best non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from power supply brick sound was very good did also color eq sound by boosting bass muffling mids highs slightly one hand sound matched lot recorded uni vibe sounds ve heard other hand once strip treble its hard put back mix seller had day return policy days so returned they lost sale othewise would still be thinking about one was fence about whether was winner was able match true uni vibe sample treble was slightly lacking bugged me at d love keep voodoo labs micro vibe liked form factor simple controls high visibility knobs ability toe tweak controls standard 9v power supply placement all jacks can get very lush even excessive univibe sound except bass very boosted mids highs cut eq effect just kills pedal me its going back pick at bbe soul bender least favorite vibe had extreme muffling mids highs heavy boost bass band mix m pretty sure would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple think pulsed speed recollection had an overly bright blue led was first vibe bought only compared fulltone dunlop before returning had some useable sounds intensity above had an annoying womp womp womp bass note was coming from weird defect effect sound opinion intensity below was usable kind tone muffler returned one early dunlop roto vibe good choice perhaps only choice if must expression pedal controlled speed adjustment didn color tone much was problem most other uni vibes tested limited speed range awkward controls placement were most annoying me intensity range seemed less than other pedals too large footprint if mounted board also offers ability take no space board by mounting didn like when switch effect automatically at high speed due mechanical nature design some awkwardness placement controls power plug vs cables when plugged std power supply plus led indicators good flash speed durable construction although mechanical nature means time something will need lubricating may need replace internal gears or pots overpriced 2x opinion other general modulation effects univibes effectively phase effect without swooshy space age edge sound can probably modify modern phaser pedal get univibe sound which like vibrato plus analog chorus combined modern phaser close modern flanger much too space age sounding vibrato pedals can capture vibrato aspect uni vibe d recommend behringer vibrato at if like vibrato sounds uni vibes normally used their chorus setting vibrato setting didn care behringer time machine gear used testing fender american deluxe stratocaster mesa mini rectifier amplifier mesa rectifier 2x12 cabinet celestion v30 pedal train pedal board voodoo labs pedal power power supplies note vendor selectioni had very bad experience vendor bought mxr dunlop m68 from while does weigh at all review product provided separate star rating vendor feedback page recommend if choose purchase pedal or anything else be careful avoid amazon marketplace vendor called mixdspnet san jose ca addition charging restocking fee if want return pedal original condition all materials packaging getting them even acknowledge return request at all was problem took over week finally opening claim amazon get any meaningful response once they did communicate they were very unprofessional further when product was shipped back signature required recommended by amazon they were available or refused sign so after several weeks attempting return product remains unrefunded despite their confirmation could return item an refund expect ll need work further amazon end get resolved google earth view their addressed explained all mixdspnet appears be running out an apartment complex most amazon marketplace sellers just fine one really at least when comes returns also while they sell few dunlop mxr pedals looking at their site reveals their primary business they seem sell bunch other non musical widgets recommendation find vendor who musical instrument business who will provide typical no cost refunds days most large musical instrument retailers do should need they few hundred positive transactions so maybe can be ok can only comment experience was worst online transaction ve ever had shopping amazon these direct drop replacement fender standard mim stratocasters fender american standard fender american deluxe replaced tuners style fenders locking version looks just like these has thumbwheel back unfortunately locking ones difficult get gold finish can get them ultimately ordered set these non locking ones finish nice deep dark gold matches fender schaller gold hardware all gold hardware same color gold quality good they look function well however returned them because they locking ultimately decided locking tuner was more important was building if just want gold tuners don care about string locking feature playing fender strat or tele can beat these by comparison lot gold tuners price these amazon quite reasonable too pedal ok by which mean provides basic functions says does quality wise feels bit cheapish was afraid was going snap pot off or something while playing case metal feels like thinnest sheet metal they could get away building from power switch chorus vibrato switch were clearly cheapest switches they could find easily accessible by toe gotta bend over flip those they small other hand was only sixty nine bucks relatively inexpensive multifunction effect pedal don care rear facing upwardly angled input output power jacks pedal board friendly opinion nice tabletop effect footprint fairly huge board at about x approx standard 9v center negative power supply postive excuse pun if looking way play signal modulation echos vibratos reverbs old style choruses bad way get started playing can make lot sounds without breaking bank personally other effects make these sounds do smaller space so me keeper your situation might be different than mine bad product acceptable at price point just didn impress me much

1125	 wanted something inexpensive well made decided go planet waves over similarly priced fender cable like because tip one piece instead screw price was just right when replace cable will likely buy same cable or something else by pw because all cables owned pw seems withstand abuse most effectively bought tuner over tc electronic poly tune am very happy purchase very simple use great visibility does color signal when engaged also has ability daisy chain from into other pedals currently no such need highly recommend figured would splurge buy these just some backup cables when wear out cheap center ones some match they well built feel like they can take some abuse will probably more packs shortly switch out all cables

carrying case can be desktop or clipped laptop monitor kinks system muffled audiothe included software cakewalk music creator le can be installed one computer get days register installed registered immediately would allow me put registration code saying wasn system administrator am windows pc says am alas wouldn work software optional decided install prior microphone per instructions try out eventually ended up uninstalling soon after installing cakewalk had pc issue muffled audio recording no amount system tweaking seemed fix was stumped then decided go samson site see if there were updated drivers mic generic ones installed were from no luck began reading online about muffled audio windows pcs somewhere noticed name recognized realtek which was name associated speakers pc realtek digital audio went realtek site noted updated drivers windows bit decided download install them rebooted pc tested out audio recording once more much delight solved muffled audio problem did set bitrate highest level best sound quality recording afterwards tested out mic using camtasia camstudio both worked beautifully samson go mic desk at distance about mic pics up voice perfectly dictation screencasts no hiss hum breath noises or distortion very clear properly installed drivers audio works perfectly usb connection powered usb hub conclusion buy great recordingsthis mic truly great if recognized properly configured by your system impressively clear recordings unlike any ve been able obtain using aplantronics audio usb multimedia headsetor mic mymicrosoft lifecam cinema 720p hd webcam black price don think can do better compact has great voice pick up audio recording clarity installation issues may occur updating audio drivers using powered usb hub connection tweaking audio settings within operating system should give quality ve been hoping at price right update 13been using mic consistently couple months m liking condenser mic doesn filter out ambient noise well d like however an under forty dollar purchase m still very happy cakewalk never has registered correctly system so uninstalled guess if anything been downside purchase smart design excellent performance what more could want samson meteor mic usb studio microphone cardioid mic easy set up use great pick up desktop podcasts user testing screencasting similar being relatively new user anything basic desk mic had look up what cardioid meant found solid explanation at site called wisegeek they explain cardioid several different microphones been designed throughout years accomplish very different tasks some such condenser microphones pick up great deal sound from several directions while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction latter group cardioid microphone perhaps most popular picks up almost exclusively desired sound while ambient noise hardly noticeable gets its name because its pattern sensitivity which roughly shaped like heart when drawn out an axis means most sound picks up comes from front microphone while minimal noise picked up from rear only marginal noise picked up from sides apologies those pros out there who didn need clarification having used samson go mic usb compact mic few months was familiar samson brand prior receiving mic through amazon vine program had actually wanted purchase instead go mic price difference about thirty was bit too much me at time ve been happy thesamson go mic compact usb microphone plug n playfor use desktop laptop pcs do lot usability testing various websites imperative clients able clearly hear explanations via voice without background noise pops hisses or similar say samson meteor touch better offering clear crisp recording reproduction also seems pick up virtually no background noise which fabulous like retro styling meteor built stand great desktops less portable than samson go mic stand does fold neatly onto mic easy transport included soft pouch included usb cable also ample length easy set up multitude situations mute button front meteor very handy much easier than using software get job done an amber light makes easy recognize muted build quality mic excellent very solid high end feel can use integrated headset port monitor your voice adjust levels dial rotates around mute button front samson meteor didn ship any software which while unnecessary installation windows pcs automatically installed when hooked up via included usb would been nice some music mixing or other similar software bundled another product m reviewing samson c01ucw studio usb mic cakewalk sonar leand samson go mic both ship cakewalk software samson go mic cakewalk music creator le c01ucw ships cakewalk sonar le software so found kind surprising meteor did at price point me works out others software they work meteor included booklet includes quick start guide pc mac installation how layout diagrams specifications polar patten frequency response recording techniques vocals acoustic piano amp overhead drum kit samson meteor mic warranty card also booklet overall m very pleased microphone will be using instead go mic desktop daily work which will include using dragon voice recognition software purchased an adapter use ipad so can play garage band know will be great future screencasts only disappointment lack an included software package which other samson products mentioned packaged them give product out stars like reason if samson included software d be star product me received these tascam headphones part amazon vine review program was excited receive them ve looked at them many times considered ordering due reasonable price point professional grade designation m an audiophile nor am snob about audio devices any brand works well at right price ll buy being said ve recently been fortunate enough get try out lots headphones thebose ae2w bluetooth headphones blackbeing most recent obviously bose beat tascam ones so would be unfair compare them other than say sound wise can really tell difference mid high range these tascam th r professional grade headphones don sound clear me mid high ranges bass great even when tweaking equalizer settings never could find clarity was seeking full range listened several genres classical blues pop rock electronic country latino these headphones each time quality was good great despite attempted software device adjustments iphone pc andyamaha rx v675 channel network 3d av receiver airplay black fit headphones big me usually they too small having them small could make them top head ears cups still dropped down bit lower than liked had hold them place get solid fit padding underneath headpiece minimal after about minutes use top head hurt build quality these phones appears be excellent cord thick can be extended an estimated screw adapter 5mm 3mm allows use multiple devices stereo components sound boards foldable design does allow some size reduction much these headphones will appeal those who like heavy bass great those who want chunky headset look go djing or larger heads they those looking wide range subtlety their listening they re also those smaller heads

1240	 very awesome item really useful tuning haven had any problems at all so far looks very nice wasn terrible someone who was beginner electric guitars amp after while becomes less less useful
1241	 years had every kind capo out there right one one works buy one each your guitars keep them case they well made inexpensive enough never has watts sounded so loud clear never think only hadan inch speaker just enough effects leave your pedals at home practices light weight easy carry works advertised keys stiff pads take too much presure activate nice dont need another interface connect laptop after first few uses usb socket broke fell off into unit rendering useless wrote dealer was listed selling me thru amazon only them tell me wrong seller was listed had registered akai already so complained them they sent me new one had pay shipping back old one them even though was defective product recommending product was dissapointed find out can only use one theeffects at time good though they were too expensive foronly one effect at time returned

1244	 spend few extra bucks get music stand sturdier these can support heavy stuff will knock over so easily they sure portable though bad idea keep one your car just case since folds up be so tiny thing awesome really nice looking heavy duty costs few bucks very high quality seems like will last ever love tone do your research though plenty distortion plenty bass treble makes tubescreamers sound like band pass filter one setting like only button or knob use turn or off would never use record price an awesome choice totally sufficient live situation if your amp doesn reverb or just want easily turn reverb or off
1245	 okay ve bought stands less were more balanced sturdy little safety strap nuisance more than help little foot stool really sturdy stays place beautifully no rocking sideways no wobbly action if one notches doesn do re screwed there no gradual adjustment positions allows make sense players price owe yourself get at least one these little things better yet get one each own they re reliable easy use accurate can mount these such way display points be back headstock way they re easy read don screw up look your why no star review because they re battery eaters provided battery lasts about month then starts dimming cool rechargeable version would be good

life great try buy bt speaker amazon wattage cordless works from battery power will spend well over included battery worthless dies about minutes installed 550mah rechargeable 9v battery ebay lasts forever plus can still use lower quality jam amp when want price its hard beat ordered pedal based previous review me sounds cheap faint do few behringer pedals many very good price one won be keeping me wasn even close good what get fender amps or tc electronics delay pedal which includes chorus vibrato thought would go solo pedal me no go do own few behringer pedals many very good sounding their price range pedal will stay collection ve spent few pedals order try many other pedals within same effects range because some believe just costly what get sound quality usually far apart would put pedal category 1st compressor pedal while dint think really needed type pedal price thought would give try wow behringer dc9 dynamics compressor pedal greatly enhances sounds every other pedal pedal board plus get volume control knob allows me drop amp output level below where amp set so can go quiet an apartment at late hours watt amp nice so would say majority people will absolutely love pedal ordered pedal based previous reviews me sounds very tinnie cheap plus control knobs were bit tight hard adjust do few behringer pedals many very good price one won be keeping me wasn even close good fender amp reverbs well love da fender products always always will recently built me nice custom strat had been testing out few various mini tube amps out market lately which where would categorize amp even though has better tubes more watts these comparison testing amps own both amps below also tried number others music store down road blackheart killer ant blackheart cabinet vox ac4tv8 watt compact all tube practice amp celestion vx10 speaker also speakered out blackheart cabinet ve also tested all amps various ways by re tubing them number collected tubes groove tubesjj tubessovtek tubessvetlana tubestung sol tubes gold straight out box thing beat them all sound quality even what lot people calling cheap fender speaker version also plugged champ into blackheart speaker cabinet sounded even better using strat will do more speaker testing later fender amps always leaned sounding better fender guitars where gibson epiphone type guitars really sound pretty good vox blackheart models now when amp came out was way overpriced always price has fallin into reasonable range mean price all these mini tube amps minimal comparison nicer ones again thing loaded better guts so maybe why screams better ya hoo me likey better guts better performance plus fender has added an extra range effects amp sounds its small size light weight loud easy carry jam sessions well over past years ve been running through bunch these mini micro battery powered small tubed solid state model budget amplifiers lets see done all blackheart small amps vox mini ac4tv roland micro cube plus few other small amps just sold fender super champ xd wasn going get another amp because playing apartment neighbors just cannot jam way d like really liked all above named amps they really didn give me options cranking without disturbing neighbors loved fender super champ probably best there wasn headphone jack same blackhearts vox ac4tv potential these amps just couldn be used by me so settled vox mini 4watt because has headphone jack also c or battery powered among lot other great features sounds did give up tube amp option so said sold super champ like week ago was mailing out using amazon online mailing appz when saw picture price browser new fender mustang figured what hell lets see what its got offer under mean everyone was giving star rating so whats bucks even though ve never had good sounding solid state amp well must say thing rocks there like phases model amps most didn like at first was able fine tune most em sound pretty great mean its only amp so cannot be compared real deals does stand up pretty nice plus has headphone jack couple other plugins effects thing will blow your ears out most amplifier headphone jacks tap out never got loud enough me thing screams blow out your ears ve had now like days was thinking about sending back there nothing market can compare or compete its sound low pricing options so m now glad sold fender super champ xd bought one put other back pocket ya best solid state amp ve ever owned still miss tube option m sure something better will appear next year until then well person just cannot go wrong by buying fender amp luv had version amp isnt much different they both cheap sound great plus u can connect computer software

1333	 nice little tuner small easy read use has non backlit lcd display an analog vu style meter extra marks at plus minus cents red leds light when tone sharp or flat has green led large mark being target has built mic acoustic instruments mono inch phone jack electric instruments has an active tone can switch tuning only adjustable over narrow range 480hz uses pair aaa size batteries pop whole case open change if any vision problems display might be an issue lcd about inches long an inch high like all non backlit lcd displays has narrow viewing angle reflection issues wanted tuning didgeridus was making works adequately one thing lacking disappointed me frequency or octave readout gives note cents sharp or flat does give an octave number or frequency sound so know tuned c just don know exactly which c probably much an issue if tuning regular instrument some cases would be very handy know suppose more training experience could learn tell by ear what learn skill isn asking bit much suppose an inexpensive tuner trade off does detract from usefulness tuner purposes other than seems work well consistent easy use compact consider about average value does basics well missing what consider an important function such device may be expecting too much price done an exhaustive study tuners their specs having octave feature would make stars me instead three any case if don need know actual octave or frequency just accuracy notes tuning works quite well very expensive played listened used audio amps over decades while haven owned every name brand amp planet do know way around them well enough spot good deal when see one nice little practice amp electrified acoustic an input mic xlr no phantom power cd player or other audio source also has headphone output inch has three tone controls separate volume mic inputs got originally mother who used sing an andrews sisters type group back day she still loves sing wanted small amp mic practice do occasional small jam she hasn had opportunity do yet tested amp put through its paces think will work fine kind thing she has mind lack reverb or processing mic bit drawback considering what paid can complain now gigging amp at least opinion your mileage may vary small solid state an inch speaker watts power haven measured exact output so m taking behringer word like behringer they can turn out some pretty good gear within its limits like sound amp carvin acoustic fishman preamp an inexpensive practice amp so don expect same kind quality would from more serious combo amp inch speaker obviously going give kind sound quality good inch no matter what question does amp provide sonic quality flexibility needed allow serious practice work composition or just moderate entertainment value me answer clear yes however an inexpensive practice amp if approach attitude think will find nice little amp don plan using your next tour manhattan transfer seal or celine dion while haven used lot capos playing used or different types easily best batch while all capos require certain amount fiddling get them hold strings down just right each different one was pretty easy dial had very little trouble getting position which gave good clear tones from each string without having mess tuning action grip release mechanism easy delivers firm pressure strings fact only negative found was height capo made bit difficult fret near higher strings some chords overall very good capo can recommend without hesitation love tascam gear used nearly years was excited try out interface see what could do unfortunately was disappointed while construction mechanical function device itself were good actual function computer left much be desired also complete lack manual one got made very difficult understand functions sorry device expensive which includes cds software how hard would be include full manual install cd there was very small quick start guide included which basically just named various switches inputs outputs gave extremely sparse directions about using software mixer screen was forced into trial error see if could get serious recording anything remotely resembling multi track mode could could record layer multiple tracks was using audacity didn want install cubase could get playback from previous tracks while also had live input now could been computer or audacity an older win xp machine played back multiple tracks without problem there was nothing mini guide address or even hint where one should look other than going tascam web site m sorry just good enough device expensive there should be complete manual at least pdf included product if am going use do serious recording last thing want do waste huge amounts time digging information out website or worse from user community threads some blog which brings me another minor complaint no linux drivers included use mostly linux only one windows machine software which can get linux wanted try software under wine linux was under time constraints then there generic problems software interfaces replacing hardware hardware mixer can access many controls fingers can handle or some mixers at same time computerized mixers can only do thing at time one must be constantly moving cursor from one thing another access controls controls interface were very fussy position cursor just exactly very small portion button get react found very tedious again no actual instructions were included help process touch screen might be easier then why just use buttons real mixer case yeah know touch screens cool also software based functions always limited by your computer os means everyone can different experience consistency much harder maintain am old school find hardware mixers far more responsive useful know lots people all excited about having software versions hardware their computers saving space etc etc value function over fashion however what always liked about tascam gear was supremely functional software falls far short what expect from tascam lack manual interface inexcusable good mixers especially multi track recording can be complex difficult learn layers signal interconnection can be hard understand at first takes some time get comfortable old tascam manuals actually used certain amount instruction multi track recording which was helpful aspiring recording artists so here had really hoped give or stars sadly only rates if could me come tascam can do better than

will compare mic costs three times much no likely find high end professional studio eh probably pretty sweet deal at price point hells yes ve worked way up terms mic quality hobby has gotten progressively more serious nicest mic own right now difference quality between even nice dynamic mic immediately obvious use recording vocals voice again pro finicky record usually sounding pretty muddy even nicer dynamic mics usually used vocals sm57 was still case mic voice sounds much more clear open admittedly very subjective evaluation then aren all mic evaluations subjective can go all day about response range eq flatness what matters end how mic sounds your application ears mic sounds wonderful only real gripe sensitivity pattern doesn seem be super tight cardioid because still picks up some sound coming from behind perhaps how supposed be when trying record both vocals loud electric simultaneously can be headache trying jury rig an isolation method works took off star alone although may be fair since haven used any other large diaphragm condensers therefore no idea if they re all supposed behave way m primarily guitarist keep an inexpensive sx bass around when m self recording whatnot since isn primary instrument don play bass live well yet never made sense invest bass amp bought liven up tone when recording hope removing some sterility bass plugged directly into firewire interface does job makes sound warmer more amp like honestly if ve been doing some homework about thing should know what think behringer build quality can be dubious sometimes overall their stuff produces sounds should satisfy anyone who isn picky audiophile box no exception ve never personally played through sansamp would hazard guess if know what want won satisfy if want something like sansamp could do lot worse than venture some bucks little box ears sounds quite good get if fills need re broke knocked off star behringer usual build quality although mine hasn broken from gentle use yet look at pedal look at what does what costs tuner pedal form factor if don even try hunt down lower price by contrast boss tu essentially same thing more durable housing costs retail yes housing made plastic don know about generally won be leaping both feet onto tuner middle set if treat your gear any respect whatsoever should survive if doesn so what cheap replace other person here obviously got faulty model which happens mine developed touchy input jack over time actually earlier tu model don know totally unexpected pedal cheap one star off these kinds quality control problems just be fair own three other behringer pedals well they re still going strong tuner an essential part any musician rig does job just fine use money save towards buying really nice stompbox will actually affect your sound while playing update after having used new tuning pedal some time will admit yes subpar tuner however still stand by original opinion amount money pay isn bad investment guitarist just starting out would still make good first tuner when really want spend your money pedals will affect your sound pretty much ideal tuner far m concerned true bypass brilliantly visible easy read dark stage accurate small footprint durable powers all your other pedals under especially if bought used its virtues many varied if ve been using cheap crappy tuner like was ll notice difference all more if want hyper accurate tuner some kind technical work pitchblack tolerances might be quite what re looking far stage tuners go got tighter tolerance than boss stompbox if want buffer your chain pedal won supply true bypass if want hear your strings ringing out while tune pedal output muted while tuner engaged prefer make audience listen me tune so me non issue plus like being able use pedal killswitch these only circumstances can think where there might be valid reason buy pitchblack right instant edit after some time pedal ve noticed when used power other pedals some them don like being daisy chained from pedal power output most notably tremolos when daisy chain cable connected straight power supply pitchblack powered like any other pedal problem vanishes kind strange figured worth noting here don consider enough problem take any points off or recommend box any less disclaimer am big muff connoisseur ve never owned one before also tend like fuzz an effect d characterize box cross between distortion fuzz maintaining enough definition chord work if re reading reviews ve probably already done your research features ll cover them anyway three simple controls volume tone sustain sustain control being more or less gain control enclosure smaller pedalboard friendly size pedal incorporates two supposedly most popular big muff mods switches tone wicker when tone switched off tone control its tone shaping circuitry completely disconnected mode distortion applies entire tonal spectrum evenly also produces significant volume boost tone knob does nothing when wicker switched removes three high frequency rolloff filters were added original big muff circuit smooth out sound disconnecting these makes sound bit raspier rougher high end frequency boost use pedal running into mild overdrive catalinbread dirty little secret which conditions signal play tone off wicker even volume sustain controls set fairly low combination results wonderfully thick massive distorted tone still pretty smooth if re looking get big muff re snob about which version switchable mods one really great experimenting find your own sound mention at price point will be much cheaper than some vintage muffs highly recommended

1373	 let me begin public service announcement if want buy other ezdrummer expansion packs need buy product first important update toontrack scheduling public release ez drummer may if buy ez drummer from now until then will also get download bear mind ezd2 completely new different program from ezd1 so would jump opportunity considering get stock ezd1 pop rock kit which has some very kit pieces addition ezd2 default kit which more reminiscent rock expansion kit from what ve seen ez drummer also gives ability mix mash kit pieces from all expansions so me makes ez drummer must buy based sheer customization available resume normal programming if an amateur musician want quality virtual drum kit ezdrummer probably best bang buck ll find very easy use very easy program overall well made product might be tempted compare ezdrummer its bigger better brother superior drummer made by same company superior drummer superior ezdrummer little more tedious more suitable musicians who want an exact close life sounding virtual instrument there ways improve off shelf sound quality ezdrummer immediately youtube has plenty video tutorials what want do open up your digital audio workstation pro tools cubase etc set ezdrummer multi track output from there ll be able tweak different outputs ezdrummer has if were studio had mics at your disposal most high end professional studios use about mics capture everything drum kit so virtual mics nothing scoff at kick drum snare top bottom toms cymbals overhead room once each those outputs running can perform individual eqs change tone dramatically adding touch distortion gain room reverb will make stock kit sound really close life reality once additional instruments layered everything mixed balanced only takes trained ear tell virtual kit far expansions go if looking record particular style music then highly recommend buying ezx kit goes genre stock rock kit very good after performing mods above only rock me personally did best eq tweak crap out get nice metal tone end found rock kit lacking especially since tight kit toms cymbals hi hat snare kick bought pedal years ago like most guitarists who buy new gear fell victim confirmation bias regarding reviews gave musician friends upfront pedal sounds great store if demo pedal ll quickly be able zero whatever distortion prefer over time ll get very frustrated actual tone distortion itself turn any knobs past ll get some undesirable nasal hissy tinny frequencies require compression noise gating eq tame top boost does provide what advertises if pedal itself already dimebagged engage top boost just sounds weird unmusical electro harmonix great pedal manufacturer think they overstepped their bounds one where pedal now collection sold cash after deciding bite silver bullet purchase boss me multi effects simplify gigging setup figured nice an analog distortion like metal muff would never compete digital distortion onboard me boy was wrong after getting me did an b test me took home gold easily came at no surprise considering both boss mxr respected manufacturers when comes distortion sounds what would recommend purchase depends if re metal band re recording an ep no pedal opinion comes close fully cranked tube amp distortion however if your amp doesn good distortion channel or capability then more conservative affordable boss ds more musical metal tone reality most manufacturers great distortion pedals so really depends your subjective standards tone since no two distortions sound same personally recommend mxr fullbore metal pedal wish had bought instead metal muff noise gate mid scooper switches far better pedal accessories than top boost fullbore also has mid frequency shaping knob which can dramatically shape overall sound bottom line up front if play an orange vox or marshall don necessarily need an eq pedal putting one your signal chain will take your amp next level why well brits design their amps wide musical eq overall frequency response narrow has led many british amp manufacturers include specialized tone shaping buttons control panel because they well aware british eq isn dramatic american guitarists want be there nothing wrong by any means just an overall characteristic british amplifiers secondly any tube amp loves be pushed boost dirt pedals get extra crispy overdrive from clean channel since distortion channels tube amps tendency compress limit output slightly pedal more than capable providing boost 15db seems be right amount push clean dirty or dirty overdrive or overdrive distortion live performance if re rock band plays small venues like bars clubs ve probably noticed most bands overwhelming bass midrange noise 500hz drowns out vocals clarity drums or any instrument matter applying eq your signal chain will allow clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low end from picture boosting your high end better clarity recording direct if re using pedal di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface virtual reamping ll be able get more balanced signal if want darken your strat or brighten your les paul why stars yes noise bothersome by any means if re recording mic d amp or direct will absolutely need noise suppressor use ge boss ns ns completely removes white noise generated from ge result an amazing clean boosting eq if re fence go ahead get thing won regret just tone snobs can really make cheap gear sound way better take great gear next level bottom line up front behringer vt999 vintage tube monster indeed monster pedal those seeking hot rodded sound your amp would be wise check product out level boost gain derived from stock 12ax7 enough push any tube amp clean channel into saturated overdrive featuring band eq ranges from barely noticeable perhaps too much was surprised actually found myself backing off some knobs because expected be cheap pedal needed eq be pushed max order get any playable tone out was wrong master gain knobs work exactly like tube amp channel noise suppressor nifty feature drastically reduces white noise roughly taking up space standard pedals your pedalboard many probably wonder if even worth real estate compared other overdrives however when comes tube based pedals big par course stock tube decent point where can get some musical tones out pedal personally don plan changing stock tube any time soon because want test its limits gain range effectively boss od ds so yes possible get some metal tones out pedal especially those late 80s early 90s marshall driven metal tones honestly can say anything overtly bad or wrong pedal judge gear ears by its value by price honestly literally can go wrong there worse pedals could buy more money quite honestly even mod change tube something more your preference re still looking at relatively inexpensive pedal an amazing value if re looking other tube overdrives check these out effectrode tube drive maxon tbo true tube boost overdrive ibanez tube king if re fence thing go ahead jump over get one

1398	 reason bought pedal was space setting which essentially shimmering organ octave up effect shortest time still slightly off tracking can get crowded chords does sound ethereal choir y features time controls delay time between dry wet signals decay controls length reverberations tone controls color reverb mix controls level wet dry can basically cut all dry signal if desired trails feature can hold reverb sound until decays even switch off however if your mix set max wet signal no sound will come through if enable pedal off haven really been able use effectively so just leave trails off dual ins outs useful plugging another instrument sounds classic reverb sounds spring plate room chamber aren very distinct from one another hall setting bit more expansive ducking nice continual shift from note note removing excess reverb latest notes chords played cave tile bit different timbre than other reverb sounds echo setting acts like short regular digital delay cons blue led very bright all behringer pedals just cover up sticker still shows through foot switch digital so doesn preserve state doesn best assuring click because buffered bypass effect will continue draw power from battery if cable plugged into even when off battery difficult get because press both sides switch then lift upalso almost pedals weight bottom metal plate which can be removed makes pedal almost toy like weight pros bought pedal primarily place volume pedal or swell pedal because does function fairly well lot cheaper aside from also does nearly every other type delay needed tape digital analog switch slightly changes sound each delay trails feature can be useful holding sound swell mode high repeats when pedal off then playing over notes or harmony time knob acts like an analog knob pitch shifting when turned after playing note repeats knob can go from little more than one repeat self oscillation sometimes runaway depending delay type mix knob can nearly cut out dry signal stereo input allows multiple instruments play into itwhile pedal has small problems compensates by inexpensive fixescons modulation kind adjustable width depth all one knob isn best compared chorus pedal just general warblethe blue led very bright point where can see settings knobs so cover sticker still shows through enough haha casing plastic thick durable enough maybe consistent gigging being digital effect footswitch state dependent other words if turn off pedal unplug plug back pedal will turn because buffered bypass effect will continue draw power from battery if cable plugged into even when off battery difficult get because press both sides switch then lift up there no noticeable click when change delay type however led flashesother notes almost half weight pedal bottom metal plate pedal without feels shockingly lightweight has good amount heft so decided amplify martin dreadnaught really really nice acoustic didn want spend lot if just wouldn sound good pickup saw had consistently good ratings can speak other acoustic pickups far exceeded expectations don plan buying more expensive piezo or soundhole pickup attaching itunfortunately narrow portion barrel long enough fit through end tail block didn want drill new hole so cheap just test out relatively cheap pickup so attached pickup regular position inside body behind bridge just ran cable out from sound hole jack held onto pickguard some scotch outdoor mounting tape which kind like really strong gum can be removed without leaving sticky residue which holds place well enough plug cable move around long don jerk quickly sound qualityi plugged into cheap regular amp whoa package mentions two locations can place pickup because needed run through sound hole could only place where more treble picked up so compensate amp by turning down treble or lowerbecause pickup transducer no electrical feedback interference picked up so sound will be very clear crisp would probably sound even better an amp better electric shielding only noise get even at max gain max input volume from amp itself heard every instrument plug into if turn master volume up too high another thing consider transducers pickup vibrations so won pick up sound when placed millimeter away from body will when touching so mind pickup will strongly output every sound make body like brushing up against your body zipper hitting your fingers sliding strings etc don know if lives up all hype mystical powers all mighty vintage tube screamers ibanez an exact clone including same component values potentiometers ics jrc etc proof exactly same was able modify different frequency response corner frequency add asymmetrical clipping exact same components exactly same spot circuit seen ts9 mods course board layed out little differently only reason gave really stars was because does produce some noticeable noise hiss at higher gains expected given boosting stage acts like high pass filter gives characteristic mid range boost can be cut tone control also may been due poorly shielded amplifier or one spot power adapter pedal has great range function variable width depth along an independent level control tone controls low high frequency cutoffs also has dry through output can go from low depth high speed shimmers high depth low speed oscillations ridiculous warble pedal light weight very high quality durable quite good looking all around good pedal play around cons blue led like many blue leds very bright usually cover them up sticker so can see setting pedal can also be easy accidentally touch pedal casing positive barrel when plugging can frighteningly spark so make sure plug power adapted into pedal before plugging wall bought these cable use pedal board they don disappoint they re fairly flexible solid construction different colors easy identifying

1401	 these headphones kind classics very popular can read all about them headphone review websites they certainly cut above your cheap headphones however when compare them other headphones sennheiser hd595 find these very very inferior had originally intended them be used digital piano because wanted some isolation which hd595 do provide these do provide isolation sound markedly inferior think closed style headphones just up task reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones use these at work now they excellent at blocking out room noise they provide enough quality me listen music while working unfortunately they also nearly comfy sennheisers they bit too small ears guess they get hot overall they just good they were good price though they fill niche need if only could find set really high quality closed cans piano now use these cables go from balanced outputs digital piano pro model xlr outs inputs studio monitors or audio interfaces works every time balanced signal so much better no more issues ground loops or other problems just clear bell they were cheap build quality fine use cable run from balanced xlr outs digital piano balanced trs inputs audio interface works perfectly there plenty length am happy build quality would recommend anyone use little guy connection daw digital piano run piano sounds through balanced cables into line ports recording also run vst intruments daw trigger via usb midi from piano use device digital audio conversion listen through sennheser hd headhphones plugged also some studio monitors attached using balanced cables purchased upgrade from previous audio interface behringer uf0202 device worked quite well purpose well lacked two things volume knob balanced outs volume knob thing could work around current monitors seem susceptible ground loops even ground lift plug so needed go balanced cables m glad did balanced cables completely eliminated noise problems was good purchase however would say anyone who doesn need balanced cables budget they should consider behringer tiny fraction price works pretty well further class complaint so don use behringer drivers plug play some good things say about focusrite scarlett 2i2 all about hardware some bad things all about software ve tried using driver version which came disk udpated which downloaded from focusrite website let know what need an interface balanced stereo out2 high quality headphone amp3 volume knobs headphone amp main line4 good digital analog conversion5 low output latency input latency important me don use mic preamps which one big selling points device good box simple well designed does what want has very convenient controls has high build quality m pleased digital analog conversion has great big volume knob another headphone amp has switches so each input can be line or microphone pre amp has switch zero latency monitoring whatever coming headphone amp was particular concern me use headphones lot poor headphone amp can be quite problem behringer headphone amp was only ok specifically has an output impedance ohms rule thumb good headphone amp matching output impedance should be impedance headphones hd ohms impedance breaking rule get distortions frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass most manufacturers don list their output impedance possibly because they embarrassed anyway focusrite does which one reason trust them little more output impedance less than ohms respectable amazing still low would need principle can notice an improvement bass response headphones there plenty extra voltage here too so could drive higher impedance cans if necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced ins outs work very well ins accommodates trs style xlr light around them shows when something actually coming shines red when danger clipping there lots gain available them turned all way down almost outs trs style balanced or unbalanced located back like look box red metal case front back sturdy attractive well usb cable just type b port means can replace if gets damaged or whatever behringer example was hard wired its cable king annoying bus powered actually would been fine wall wart even more simple really no complaints whatsoever about hardware bad driver thing horrible under windows xp clean installation nothing installed except daw software acrobat reader driver mean computer really stripped down performance using behringer was good latency time between playing note hearing out speakers was ms using behringer which isn really perceptible unfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently doesn anything like an acceptable latency lowest latency could set at get sound out instead crackles pops was ms at level instrument begins sound very sluggish laggy very difficult at least me work large latency like was ready return device when decided last ditch effort install asio4all sort an asio driver use if absolutely cannot make manufacturer driver perform at decent level installed worked output latency was tiny ms only which actually output latency so really impressive conclude hardware very very good machine software horrible unfortunately can actually uninstall focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn recognize device never even turns class compliant unlike behringer so now two drivers installed only one which use bad news configuration very buggy general when just turn computer try play vst instrument all get crackles pops until open asio configuration panel increase buffer funny thing doesn matter where buffer starts out always increase before get any good sounds out can start out huge buffer lots latency will crackle until open increase buffer yet more do every time turn computer also sometimes if leave while come back will be crackly again until increase yet another step we talking about major bugs here decided try ditching asio4all trying make focusrite drivers work again maybe there was setting was missing was trying set buffer size heard sound an explosion then computer rebooted when came back couldn get good sounds out even when turned buffer way up tried rebooting few more times still didn work so uninstalled re installed focusrite software at first didn work had install asio4all well now can sort get sounds out half time hope getting idea these drivers terrible awful monkey could written better driver would give star if wasn fact device works very very well when all stars align driver recognizes drive allows play guess m willing sacrifice convenience stability nice hardware when works would never use live situation or when time critical good thing about drivers they can update fix them m hoping they already revised driver once which amazing because even driver seriously an abomination just like closing thoughts unfortunately there really isn usb interface has good driver behringer driver always worked if moved interface from one usb port other was no longer recognized had reinstall driver however didn use behringer driver asio4all would give ms perform without any complications about trouble free ve seen type device if read about presonus audiobox usb m audio fast track pro probably two closest competitors focusrite what get bunch comments just like one horrible horrible drivers never get fixed actually mackie makes competitor well onyx blackjack reviews show driver possibly even worse than one unfortunately none pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers so we live unstable systems only work half time maybe better under mac don know interestingly really only usb device range quite shocking considering how long usb standard has been around only real implication usb devices like m audio presonus can only do two channel audio or out both at same time there enough throughput usb so light competition focusrite looks kind ok unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers at least range device think there no need good hardware especially good software at least hardware one up spec we can cross our fingers improved drivers future bottom line fantastic star device if can make software work consistently if tight budget or don care about balanced out d recommend go behringer uca202 or ufo2020 they tons cheaper class complaint better drivers if use high impedance headphone even headphone amp pretty good one update may new version driver came out since writing above new driver actually works stopped using asio4all get decent latency once while too often will inexplicably require me edit settings increase buffer some percentage time when do will reboot computer if don change anything most time works ok would never use mission critical setting e gigging or pro work home use good enough now if issues driver definitely update

1426	 usb condenser mics more specifically one great doing podcasts portability reason being they condensers one other mic has built interface an interface glorified sound card both microphone preamp analogue digital digital analogue ad da converters course most any standalone interface going give way more desirable results than just plugging microphone into mic jack your computer way way better so mxl studio usb even built interface going give quality far exceeding your computers potential so instead having carry separate interface around having all one mxl studio usb all need laptop usb input there limitations though usb mic main one being can only record microphone without being able plug any instruments although could record instruments using microphone way be able layer more tracks your daw recording multiple tracks at same time possible mic unless recording same thing multiple tracks really good thing about mic getting some pretty decent quality money so anything need do using microphone your one only sound device ideal quick easy affordable one problems using pro tools or any daw can only use one interface at time since mic has built interface can use any other even garage band mac although they ability use more than one interface because can toggle between two be able use two simultaneously so plain words if planning studio capabilities usb mic what need couple mxl condenser mics bought studio mxl v57m which was their early offering no longer made found mxl v250 be comparable one some other mxl like muddy bottom end when bottom fishing good decent condenser mic some cad offerings also top sellers when using mxl usb win no driver download necessary if your mic comes without included cd can download free mxl studio control app which includes input controls microphone gain an adjustable high pass filter also has nose gate adjustable threshold there also output adjustments well one other thing unique about usb mics working your pc they dependent course your pc so had hardest time trying figure out what was wrong when couldn get output from pc or into free reaper daw recording software free day trial also downloadable from mxl so finally gave up after trying various input options etc discovered through troubleshooter windows accessible via control panel then sound then type troubleshooter into search box upper right corner answer was mic input volume inside windows was down zero moved slider up bang worked so sound quality getting decent quality price has built interface even an output jack can plug your headphones into mini jack like your computer so just your laptop mic set pod casting or any other function requires only one microphone no other channels mic comes desktop stand which an indication its intended purpose opposed studio vocal or instrument mic been playing longer than care admit back went into music store dad cherry picked finest fender telecaster whole store back then they were all handmade so there were variations by spending some time would yield an incredible find so am newbie playing or working guitars didn use capo because apart order make exact vintage reproductions body today modern guitars use medium jumbo frets had thin frets medium jumbo frets they sufficiently high if check them once fretting note something accurate snark sn all instrument clip chromatic tuner will see note moves up one or two bars tuner once fret one or two bar above note then fretting so must admit quest perfect capo would enable me adjust so doesn go out tune when using capo compared g7 performance capo six string silver schubb s1 stainless steel capo steel string guitars planet waves ns tri action capo although g7 was substantially built looked rather impressive found be too bulky so kept getting way while trying play chords so sent back so now comes down shubb deluxe planet waves went back forth these two tuners whole lot times would perfectly tune snark then apply capo tried discern difference between which one these would make go out tune more than other finally concluded there was no difference schubb s1 had ability be adjusted so fine would barely be holding neck if set one at its gentlest setting could get be almost perfectly tune even capo set softly would just about fall off so last thing want happen middle performance planet waves capo contrast even at lightest setting was still solid grip neck also noticed planet waves had wider spread across strings therefore was less critical positioning order get right schubb s1 well made product has nicely finished metal components its roller ball system fastening when loosen sure re going occasionally be dropping floor could say requires two hands order remove planet wave other hand true one handed tool makes easy remove put back tried both these one other fender telecasters well one acoustics got same tuning results all them am very critical exact so when say tuning results would change when put capo must understand tuner was only moving one line most people wouldn even bother much an adjustment know there nothing compare good strings hear tone blend those strings perfect tune perfect harmony rules know feeling when come end great song hit your last note finish full chord perfectly tune there nothing compare planet wave little bit bulkier if had get critical would say does get way tiny bit more than schubb s1 although factor such great difference preclude me choosing one over other way each them mount dismount does make me lean more strongly planet waves saw other reviews commented one type capo provided better tone than another type capo tried might could reproduce differences they spoke there so many factors affecting tone such after changing capo was body leaning little bit more one way then was last time example was face little closer ear range compared last capo tested might ve been projecting more from side also felt once capo squeezes string down only thing creating tone fret line between bridge so at least between these two found no total differences wanted say if using medium sized jumbo frets high action really bending string order fret thereby changing pitch love low action no buzzing lighter gauge strings d rather dance across top like ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings each his own they say just consider important let know m conducting experiment gauge strings tele electric gauge acoustic so if re running much heavier gauge string lower action would course less tuning shift going because could adjust capo both these round adjusting knob fine tuning be able adjust point where pressing just beyond level frets really squeezing all way down fret board therefore less challenge trying keep tune while using capo although doubt many setting way rather squeezing down fret board instead although possible heavy gauge strings can fine tune pressure sufficiently will yield tuned instrument while under load heavier gauge strings creating strong enough grip at finer setting so won slide off like shubb does at its lighter setting course all predicated upon re tuning when change capo position really only way create perfectly tuned instrument do little tweaking when change capo position m sure most people ignore consider ever so slightly out tune instrument something objectionable doesn impede overall quality their performance find other hand which perfectly tune takes music level possible no matter how little or much out tune so conclusion find planet waves easier use its longer arm capable wider fret board while at same time capable thinner fret boards well being one highly recommend notwithstanding shubb places very close second its slightly smaller size does fact get way little less than planet waves all all they both best all ones ve tried everything keeps improving getting better faster cheaper at price point their isn one available isn compromise one way or another first off if planning buying us don buy its bigger brother us getting an optical connection additional ins outs such little bit more money well 192k makes no brainer get optical only at price great d d converters leave bit be desired other hand mic pres pretty good distortion ratings thd only bit 192khz recording make these best sounding interfaces put out by tascam date what meant by compromise even interfaces cost times price most them either good mic pres weak clocks or vice versa some work windows so well mac once again vice versa etc researched interfaces long long time considering non crash reliability dozen other factors finally sprung anrme fireface ufx usb or firewire high performance audio interface out now an interface been running pro tools since pro tools professional audio recording music creation softwareis out pro tools now being released so if looking an inexpensive interface expect some compromises one area or another rather than slam out performance specs under microscope would rather provide review helping those who interested setting up tascam us or so can save lot time trying figure out sometimes little help makes huge difference amount time saved so what did was load register free included cubase le6 complete activation elicense registration installation well installing tascam driver doing updates both know lot reviews here just downloaded driver used their existing daw order test out interface therefore they didn need spend much time don blame them shortest distance between two points straight line so get out cup coffee because installing complete package doesn happen just one hour so here goes if windows vista probably out luck because system requirements list windows xp am sure omission vista mistake know mylogitech audiohub notebook speakersare non functional vista laptop if running windows media center well works win just fine so installed desktop running windows bit gives option installing or addition cubase le also installed ai elements well agent one content groove agent one vintage beat boxes steinberg drum loop expansion which took good amount time load well steinberg halion sonic se bit ai elements then had activate register cubase le6 which involves installing latest elcc creating steinberg account which free they don ask credit card they provide an activation code after register an ilok pro tools which usb device enables run program cubase does require one although they an equivalent looking device fortunately they software based equivalent they do an elicense which will then update version there an elicense control setup soft elicenser number will use order generate activation code generated at steinberg site what came disc was version which they instruct immediately do an update which did version so we install tascam interface next which comes separate dvd included interface foot usb printer style cable will need install driver disc before connecting your computer windows recognizes fails automatically load driver so install driver off disc first then do update took at least minutes do update what flashed screen was megabytes then all see an install screen scrolling series round objects moving at first says going take long time they were exactly right almost tempts think something wrong because nothing happening other than scrolling then finally after ten minutes or so dialogue box comes up says do want install click continue then comes up again another minute happens few times then finally changes over an installation finished box verizon fios usually download huge amount data flash then reboot now important plug us directly into an available usb port into hub even if powered hub simply won work tried light wouldn even come indicating usb when went direct interface lit up worked manuals also warn use usb us comes printed quick start guide there also an owner manual both interface cubase available either dvd or by googling same they come up pdf download if new setting up interfaces be prepared do good deal reading

versions until they time season some get feedback from users after some time more updates will be browsing shelves discounts upgrade maybe another year pt all need been playing more years than care admit okay bought telecaster brand new back then still love lot different guitars mostly electric acoustics electrics love extra light gauge strings only about us do can fly those do things at pace lot more difficult heavier gauge strings anyhow digress reason light gauge strings subject tuning problems if big fat frets like found gibons esp ltd when squeeze string fret light gauge strings all too easy squeeze all way fret board x large jumbo frets can be quite distance making go out tune cure using heavier gauge strings such or more so makes possible determine quite easily just where top fret without doing full squeeze all way fret board so most capo work up because there lot more tension strings so lot capos can create comfortable fit fully fretting strings without them going into sharp note zone so since use lighter gauge strings even subject same limitation had hard time finding capo would sit comfortably at top range between fret board still squeeze string sufficiently so create any buzz do so without making string too sharp guess what now found several capos none them make grade light gauge strings except one be honest was surprised when worked okay so here how put test used snark headstock tuner which great little tuner if know secret using also peterson hd tuner bench model which fodder another post its one tenth one cent tuning accuracy okay back explanation snark tune open string until line stays center without wavering off one side only problem most any headstock tuner seen they aren superbly accurate peterson headstock tuner sent back because was acting crazy anyhow so secret using snark which like best out headstock tuners tried tune open string first then fret string let say 5th fret will occasionally find string open position registers being tune even though may be little sharp or little flat so when strum whole chord will get desire tune so your ears can hear order get spot there nothing more beautiful than perfectly tuned nothing worse than one well out tune so by tuning open string then tuning fretted string once both tune right so open position if by chance tiny bit sharp enough register tuner when fret string example 5th fret naturally stretches string little bit making sharper which will now show snark note too sharp once balance open string fretted string really wonderfully tuned instrument don even need hear so your audience listening tune up yet get right sweet spot we all love know so well so being said can more fully understand why d addario ns artist capo cat meow first tuner ever used kept perfectly tune after clamping neck adjustable like others one sensitive light gauge strings well often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting capo one even light gauge strings must admit was surprised taking right out wrapper after going through above tuning procedure get spot immediately did job just right wasn even little bit sharp be super critical here another tip when using capo put closer fret rather than middle between two frets some reason stretches string less doing so has do tension resistance at steeper angle right alongside fret rather than farther way like middle between two frets did get tiny bit sharpness when positioned between two frets gauge strings since two most important factors comfortable use getting way when playing open chords keeping tune best way use capo simply clamp strings right above second fret example rather than right below third one right below third one gives perfect tune also just like right above second one does keeps capo way out your way matter fact am so accustomed using capo position know where finger chords sometimes make mistake fret them one lower than they belong little practice or even looking at instantly corrects say quite simply say use capo farther away from your hand just slide down being right above fret below rather than right below fret above so there capo does job perfectly light easy clamp course if can accurately handle will breeze through anything thicker out box set at its lightest setting perfect telecaster tried teles strats really same neck just different head stocks so will work same both so guess can recommend capo high enough since only one works perfectly super light gauge strings only problem being sure remember which case so can switch over when using different might get another one backup notice name input be confused amplitube irig which achieves input output through ipad ios devices headphone jack headphone connections can be noisy reliable connection problems they also depend built ad da converters ipad ios device apogee jam 96k professional quality input device has dedicated d analogue digital converter depends built hardware ipad ios device playback other hand apogee one has both ad da convertors both input output amplitube irig from ik multimedia has simple stereo headphone out jack plug plugs into your ipad built hardware ipad something love doing something like watching movie up inch screen audio phile quality need dedicated dedicated pre ad convertor what apogee jam 96k has mind has audio recording input playback handled via your headphone jack your ipad can course just use monitoring your mix then save file digital format internally send playback device pristine digital audio quality e g saving wav file makes apogee 96k jam very usable device achieve high quality recordings at very nice price so here continuum amplitube irig headphone jack input output quality built into your ipad etc apogee jam 96k digital quality conversion input only playback being handled by headphone jack ipad apogee one other hand at roughly times price gives both ad da conversions so has its own audio output jack plus tracks recording either instrument or balanced external microphone jack also comes built condenser mic pretty amazing also has volt phantom power using your favorite condenser mic when get into apogee duet quartet get more connections plus all too important option midi connectivity preferred ernie ball extra lights which nickel string they smooth depth tone which preference nyxl brighter tone good playing ease stay tune better when making new string changes if mahogany body such les paul junior specials then added top end would make very nice match or if like brighter tone any same applies these coated strings which lot strings price range output am firm believer although can notice difference quite readily between certain types stings acoustic unamplified output once plug them into an amp volume knob difference disappears these do stay tune better than usual ernie balls nickels when first put them nickel takes day stretch into tension proper pitch these their tension adjust better first day use after nickels set may notice much difference find by lightly sanding nut grit paper using big ben nut sauce all contact points string does more keeping tune than any other having these nyxl there just one more added benefit would say if looking brighter tone better tuning stability these ones can tell from wall wall star reviews these one
