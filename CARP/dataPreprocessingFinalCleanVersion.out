A27L5L6I7OSV5B	B0002CZV82	from greg abrams review entitled all tone snobs review further down product page alright so want get good if somewhat basic distortion sound less than your deal strongly disagree can find much better distortions or less even few near or under mark ds currently priced at ve played over years like many people one first pedal purchases was ds afterall everyone talks about them they re available at any given music store nation hear about all these famous musicians using them plus ds actually pretty cheap so snapped one up just like everyone else come find out just because something popular doesn always mean its good see nickelback transformers movie franchise kardashian family etc so plugged didn really care distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding always noisy tried both amps practic amp solid state fender frontman 25r big amp b at100 which 100w tube halfstack was was very diverse basic sound was very likeable me ve read japanese made ds better sound than newer made taiwan models either way ds just great pedal mind like many newer players didn know any better at time fast forward few years ve bought sold literally dozens pedals there whole world great tones be found out there if keep your eyes open so here some pedals currently own like much better than ds all them great general purpose distortions easy enough find new used most shops can at time writing be bought brand new or less here good ol amazon com rugged enough last years boss ds turbo distortion lest catch any flames from people thinking m boss hater m certainly loved tu odb md xt among others ll start ds big brother pedal has much nicer tone mention distinct distortion modes setting pretty much higher quality ds ii setting brighter richer tone ds completely overshadows ds popularity can find ds all over ebay very cheap prices very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many pro co rat2 great dirty distortion pedal probably personal favorite ve heard box used literally hundreds if thousands songs last years its used by just ridiculous amount guitarists its rich full distortion at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy ve never heard bad tone out mine its great getting big amp kind sound out small practice amp its also great pushing big amp too much headroom into overdriven sweet spot without having crank amp volume truly excellent pedal ehx little big muff big muff another pedal ve heard hundreds songs its kind fuzz kind distortion definitely owns its own sonic territory very big saturated warm used heavily classic rock tones also beyond tons grunge garage used by everyone from carlos santana david gilmour smashing pumpkins dinosaur jr jack white personally reccomend little big muff only touch creamier tone than recent nyc reissue its smaller uses regular 9v adapter its cheaper great pedal mxr distortion distortion great first distortion can usually be found pretty cheap whats nice about distortion sounds great anything lack tone knob helps keep somewhat transparent e can more easily hear natural tone your amp doesn cover over your equipments sound used by quite few famous folks including greatful deads jerry garcia randy rhoads ozzy famous guitarist steve jones sex pistols danelectro cm cool cat metal make sure get cool cat metal metal ii fine pedal well its definitely more traditional metal pedal cool cat metal or cm actually very very different pedal from most metal pedals basically its pre amp sits floor has fully adjustable eq tons volume gain through roof so can do anything from clean boost gain at minimum there virtually no coloration your tone high gain metal stuff plenty great overdrive rock tones between works well any amp ve tried can find tons great sounds its an unbelievably versatile pedal its even true bypass best part danelectro seems made way too many them so can easily find one used or even new under true hidden gem actually cheaper than ds joyo jf crunch distortion little guy surprised me its supposedly clone mi audio crunch box if so must be one awesome pedal too its essentially marshall stack box boy does ever succeed at great crunch tons volume gain really can make your practice amp sound like big ragin stack even sounded good going into modeling amp very few pedals work well modeling amp one even sounded better than marshall simualtion built can get brand new one shipped fantastic speaking joyo ve had few their pedals well one or two from moen another chinese pedal maker m honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag especially themoen mo fm fuzz moowhich honestly out big muffs every big muff ve ever played through so joyo moen they both make variety great sounding fuzz od dirt pedals check them out before anyone gets all up arms about supporting chinese company please keep mind none pedals listed review ds included made america let alone western hemisphere hopefully these suggestions give something look also if can actually try pedal out at store youtube great place hear demos what different pedals can do should also mention if try love ds suits your needs than more power tone subjective every pedal sounds different

A3H4S6YO9VNGDZ	B0006H92QK	ve been recording professionally years music radio commercials television mostly so ll try give information need make your purchase ve owned used so many mics brands through years can remember them all can say ve never had bad use every week years going back mid just lower priced electret condenser from family no idea recordings re hearing brand used by almost every studio every continent work us italy scotland can attest first let me tell very simply where negative reviewers went wrong xlr connection phantom powered mic which pro best so requires phantom powered xlr input which all pro equipment provides standard most home recording audio interfaces which should really purchase along if haven already because around ll improve your recording playback preamp monitoring ll find one by searching audio interfaces rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand focusrite use just playback office den they work well don need avid hd get started audio interface just another name an external sound card will provide proper input gain meter getting your interface away from electronically noisy computer has been sop since dawn digital see small usb mixers available which would be another option don try an adapter won work needs power through cord charge field effect transistor power supplies available after adapt however want doesn come cord what surprise quality cords will cost about half price version will probably do most doesn come ashock mountbut can purchase one if like work may need one recorded vibrations rumbling will tell do ll need windscreen popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris usual can also recommend using large foam screens top cut from one mic side address will need cover entire screen isn about being cheap there times goosenecks very inconvenient don work at strange angles ll probably always need one or other does come stand so pick up boom stand if don one pay no attention negative reviewers will tell they tip over wheelers also tip over recommendeduse sandbag or whatever leg opposite mic or remove boom top portion slide barbell weight put back together or create proper counterweight where they ve put faux plastic one if possible could mount boom from ceiling run cable hooks eliminating vibration from floor while keeping cable out waymicrophone flange male desktop users here what d do using large command strips velcro d fasten deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini boomhere another optionmxl mics mxl bcd standunderstand recording has progressed by meeting needs experimenting if need something figure out your clean quiet recording proof works can justify comparing mics like if there better value buy wouldn bought case most condensers sure beats most non electret electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics certainly an entry level professional mic many situations could be substituted without issue also individual mics sound eight prefer them use them most so when reviewers say bright say compared what can tell what sounds like ka ching great sound audio recording uh huh know one professional recording client was clueless used an mic think about would be good what was used years ago heard good recordings anyone purchasing equipment because sounds better ought earned enough slap down cash pay lot reviewers opinions about mic so don ignore them ask yourself do they formal training experience different mics many studios they using expensive gear from their console their monitors reveal its true capabilities any noticeable increase sound quality might cost won be half what ll achieve by improving your recording technique type mic excellent overhead acoustics amps or brass course vocals really most recording needs having less uni more omni cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern better suited recording just understand can get too loud near or ll overdrive since designed up screaming vocals so back off loud amps brass which also means need quiet place recording because ll pick up your ac ducts your neighbor tv good thing what bad trying do good recording noisy environment so don blame mic your extraneous room noise can just use different microphone or noise gates or processors any kind just quiet anything else pail sinking ship because an acoustical rather than electronic signal noise ratio 10db pad will reduce output doesn affect diaphragm its input acoustical foam won help even its purpose suggest reading acoustics foam music tutsplus dot com tutorials beginners guide acoustic treatment audio just replace dot turn off your heat air be careful headphone bleed do your recording between am when world quieter place will really help ll likely hear how loud your computer fans can get underground your basement or build blanket walls or buy used office partitions need quiet ve known acoustic players who ve worn gas masks cut sound their breathing if what your budget allows an excellent first step into recording type mic likely brand would be first choice first recording mic no matter cost keep saying type mic reason why because sells models like style up model lowest priced re buying reputable brand if your future plans include using only one mic without ability use any traditional recording hardware can look here audio technica at2020 usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at2020usb cardioid condenser microphone w pop filterthis advice will also lose higher quality playback supplied recording software comes an interface model usb now pay no attention descriptions how sounds won tell because how sounds me system won apply your system goes all audio descriptions worthless only unplugging one piece gear another matters important all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn recording cannot sound better than source so microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than different microphone accurate or inaccurate good or bad there difference during mix make better or different from original sound apply these same thoughts your home stereo saying instead playback cannot sound better than recording why accuracy important your monitors so search out any info don understand don expect be competent engineer without years schooling training having worked professional setting if re lucky like was after year tech school worked site repair studios often need pt apprenticed while continuing education next then after years work tv another year school became studio owner real recording involves facility equipment techniques involved surgeon hospital so study electronics acoustics auditory cortex everything audio train yourself hear smallest sounds all day never stops when making any purchases recommend reading research realize tool because can buy tool doesn mean re educated its use so yes also don recommend buying scalpel trying surgery your little brother unless everyone us started somewhere so get some equipment start recording quit all sleeping eating other unnecessary activities just read record just short sessions at real studio will also open your eyes be educational some will allow just stop talk so keep up research because no man knows all m just here help out if need good small inexpensive stereo amp check one out topping tp22 digital mini amplifier	5.0	1388016000

A2KI91IR3RA7D0	B000KIPUQG	device works here what does plug an electric bass into pedal instrument input then can plug second standard instrument cable into pedal high impedance output jack then plug one into bass amp also can connect low impedance microphone preamp via ohm low impedance xlr jack out can use just high impedance output or just xlr output or can use them both simultaneously when footswitch off functions transparently no tonal modification at all just like direct box when footswitch an led light activates tonal boost tube emulation functions put footswitch quotes because use fingers push leave all time personal purpose when insert plug into instrument input jack unit powers so if running battery be sure unplug input when actually using some other functional comments about runs volt batteries or volt power supply used batteries while switched an ac adapter battery life isn super satisfactory still if using lot suggest using an ac adapter when battery starts going sounds awful could put into bypass mode finish set also when footswitch off led lit thing functions straight xlr ouput direct box anything plug into could patch output an acoustic electric or output an electric pedal board use feed mixer recording direct which very handy feature home recording hobbyist amp emulation tone controls wrong anything other than electric bass so just use direct box tone emulation circuit off anything except bass controls all rotary knobs except ground lift switch which slide switch controls left right top row second row drive treble bass level presence ground lift slide switch blend taking each control one at time understand what they do important because they all logically placed drive knob adjusts amount gain similar cranking input stage control tube preamp here where can get something like tonal thickness or edge overdriven tube tone basically part circuit injects variable harmonics some more pleasing distortion out there purpose there no active passive pad switch or extra active input jack pedal so if an active bass then will turn drive knob up much get tone want treble knob or 12db boost cut upper frequency tones bass knob or 12db boost cut lower frequencies o clock flat or zero db boost or cut both treble bass knobs level knob master volume control all does control output volume no tonal coloration presence knob boosts upper frequency range harmonic content more attack your tone presence knob isn midrange control does boost upper mids ground lift switch only effects xlr output jack should be left off unless hook up there hum then can turn ground lift might help eliminate hum issue however better from safety standpoint remedy by eliminating electrical ground loop conflict causing hum blend knob controls amount tube emulation injected into pedal output all way left being none o clock being all way clockwise being cons very little bass gear or anything else perfect these days behringer gear has more build issues general across most their product line because using chinese parts labor how they keep costs down designed germany built china means get chinese components chinese build quality while specs look pretty enticing example at first battery change battery clip self destructed part clip terminal stayed stuck battery having pulled completely out clip was duracell battery standard pedal batteries went radio shack got replacement battery clips fixed new clip by soldering wires from new clip stripped wires cut away from old clip taping up solder joint ve never used stompbox because switch looks like will break if lean hard construction all plastic casing very durable based previous experience plastic switches stomp boxes know use size d foot treble presence knobs mine will generate hiss noise when set very high which may be noticeable at all vintage type bass amp no tweeter becomes glaring when using full range amp cabinet or when using xlr output recording or pa feed basically set treble presence point where hear hiss start then back off until goes completely away because functional limit hiss no issue bypass mode because preamp off jacks other than xlr plastic box jacks soldered direct circuit board pedal these type jacks noted causing problems especially after rough use so take easy them they should last very long time unit lacks any dedicated midrange knob presence knob does seem boost upper mids treble simultaneously some people who use pedal stage tool use solo or scoop switch slap tap solos so presence bass treble boost basically all need solo switch anyway pros first foremost price almost too good be true when consider price anything else similar features keep mind has durability issues so be gentle will last indefinitely isn tech nyc bass driver by any means works similar fashion one tech bass driver deluxe use at gigs tech sounds better costs about eight times what behringer cost use behringer at home save wear pedal board at home if didn tech unit might take unit gigs probably will last way longer way keep setup at home all time especially like unit when used small rehearsal practice type combos many these smaller combos passive type tone circuits basically at flat when tone cranked wide open device really makes these little amps sound more serious part beauty an active bass tone boost capability don get passive bass if passive bass can make sound more like an active bass treble bass boost front amp also useful boosting signal front longer cable run backline say anything over about feet recording xlr direct out very useful xlr direct out can also be used feed pa at gig if your amp doesn xlr direct out how use device bass plugged into input use xlr output connect microphone mixer output from microphone mixer patched into turtle beach santa cruz soundcard an xp computer can then record using computer recording software practice solo or can play along recorded music using headphones headphones can play loud want anytime want without disturbing anyone most computer speakers very inadequate electric bass so recommend headphones instead your typical desktop computer speakers can buy better computer speakers capable they will cost about same or actually more than decent bass practice combo amp quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers bass capable having owned pedal about years knowing what know

bender well comparing some different beasts modulation family an mxr phase mxr evh flanger boss chorus behringer vibrato behringer time machine summary just factsa great pedal favorite uni vibe all doesn take lot space up standard power supply good visibility control knob settings does add or subtract frequencies signal or add noise only pedal univibe group can say about why almost certainly going be one keep might slightly less ability produce thick univibe effect some others still need play little more overall love pedal at under bucks only downsides see led does flash speed rate speed control top left which makes hard toe tweak right foot quality seems ok time will tell durability pros smallish form factor although slightly larger than boss pedal doesn take much more room than standard pedal standard power supply 9v center negative jack top back easy access way patch cables sides switchable between chorus univibe vibrato controls spaced well handling use knobs high visibility marking easy see best pro does boost or cut volume does boost or cut bass mids or lows just applies uni vibe type effect dialed retains character tone only pedal tested can say about most others cost times what one cost led red visible weird bright laser retina price at about bucks great deal quality construction metal case decent knobs pots switches no complaints so far cons led does flash speed rate speed control would be better placed top right or bottom right toe tweaking just had day so can tell might be limited getting deepest most lush univibe sound sure about will update review get time test further sounds great me overall highly recommended if want univibe don want do lot comparison shopping done some users report quality issues here guess time will tell mine works fine so far could buy still save money over most other options available notes other pedals compared fulltone mini deja vibe highest quality construction expected at large knob lower right corner speed great allows toe tweaking very useful vibe pedal complaint vibe colors tone boosts mid range tones while maintaining crisp highs slightly losing bass probably helps sound stand out mix however d rather vibe provide eq because when switch or off don want compensate at tone knobs try get back sound was able match exactly an authentic original uni vibe sound some adjusting seems kind muffle pick attack or compress also love hate relationship pedal after about week testing some days hate like build quality speed control originally liked was one only two pedals didn strip treble off tone until realized mids were boosted bass was cut pick attack was somehow tweaked mixed bag at shouldn be mxr dunlop m68 new at about new m68 uni vibe very good vibe pedal much like second place list pure sound might even like slightly better than jimi saying something perfect form factor shape size no significant coloration tone other than perhaps tiny boost treble one mode m68 gives jimi good run if extremely tight board space might be better choice they sound very similar m68 has wider range adjustment speed depth than jimi m sure extra range useful mxr jim dunlop mxr great factory customer service if ever an issue they fixed one pedals free even though out warranty really do wish mxr would move their power supply jack rear vertical surface instead right side vertical surface often way right angle plugs all other mxr use small top left push button switching from chorus vibe pedal was main negative issue d leave mini switch engaged red led burning all time looking like when was actually engaging circuit main switch was also tight fit pedal has level knob which m usually fan don see need effect didn care white main led much course power supply location led does pulse speed was annoying due white led subjective thing suppose all said great sounding option perfect mxr size so good choice still 2x cost jimi stuck jimi form function sound value dunlop uni vibe uv1 cool stainless steel construction knobs were hard see settings placement vintage switch back pedal was easily forgotten at worst awkward at best non standard 18v power supply takes double slots from power supply brick sound was very good did also color eq sound by boosting bass muffling mids highs slightly one hand sound matched lot recorded uni vibe sounds ve heard other hand once strip treble its hard put back mix seller had day return policy days so returned they lost sale othewise would still be thinking about one was fence about whether was winner was able match true uni vibe sample treble was slightly lacking bugged me at d love keep voodoo labs micro vibe liked form factor simple controls high visibility knobs ability toe tweak controls standard 9v power supply placement all jacks can get very lush even excessive univibe sound except bass very boosted mids highs cut eq effect just kills pedal me its going back pick at bbe soul bender least favorite vibe had extreme muffling mids highs heavy boost bass band mix m pretty sure would get totally lost at home might sound ok form factor was good controls were simple think pulsed speed recollection had an overly bright blue led was first vibe bought only compared fulltone dunlop before returning had some useable sounds intensity above had an annoying womp womp womp bass note was coming from weird defect effect sound opinion intensity below was usable kind tone muffler returned one early dunlop roto vibe good choice perhaps only choice if must expression pedal controlled speed adjustment didn color tone much was problem most other uni vibes tested limited speed range awkward controls placement were most annoying me intensity range seemed less than other pedals too large footprint if mounted board also offers ability take no space board by mounting didn like when switch effect automatically at high speed due mechanical nature design some awkwardness placement controls power plug vs cables when plugged std power supply plus led indicators good flash speed durable construction although mechanical nature means time something will need lubricating may need replace internal gears or pots overpriced 2x opinion other general modulation effects univibes effectively phase effect without swooshy space age edge sound can probably modify modern phaser pedal get univibe sound which like vibrato plus analog chorus combined modern phaser close modern flanger much too space age sounding vibrato pedals can capture vibrato aspect uni vibe d recommend behringer vibrato at if like vibrato sounds uni vibes normally

A35YS5ND3K5FN	B004ISK48S	constructionthis amp certainly looks sharp nearly heavy would expect 100w amp be seems well put together controlsthe iii comes button foot pedal which feels very solid works perfectly can expand add an optional button switch fender sells separately also includes iv v amp separate eq knobs treble mids low gain volume master volume reverb along these also an lcd screen tells which amp model using witch pedals presets delays reverbs also separate buttons changing amp models reverb delays modulation effects large knob top actually scrolls through presets once press can go into deep editing amp models effects presets controls intuitive easy use great mix visual digital feedback well tactile knobs comparing other amps fender gdec does much deep editing available amp itself need use your computer edit download settings properly mustang iii do feel missing out editing functionality by keeping plugged into computer don know another amp has controls both intuitive powerful sound most important let me first compare amp what line vox peavy offered past all companies gone heavy into amp modeling offer endless numbers sounds effects how many those sounds useful guitarists who learning trying create sounds based music has inspired them line offers tons sounds most them what would call niche sounds only useful when recording weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what find line their vintage tones very digital sounding sound over processed they don sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line offers oodles sounds progressive rock metal maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds unique interesting vast majority no use someone like me who learning play songs love looking useful rock blues metal tones what can say about mustang iii tones do sound digital or overly processed vintage amps some great overdriven types sounds these very passable sounds fantastic models real thing can find actual base amp models memory banks by playing these sounds get real feel what can do amps few sounds simply amazing me champ amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like little inch champ tons character tone can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through amp model think jimi blues cd presets use amp fender created all really fun sound amazing fender bassman wow can get some great bold rock sounds out amp model has recognizable tone bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end some singing highs deluxe fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal there play some great classic rock blues or leave alone beautiful clean tone british amps all good models vox marshall type amps they all bold your face just play one acdc riff into amp ll recognize sound far vintage tones go dare find anything models vintage tones well anywhere if play rock blues country hard rock or jazz so many great choices people who play churches will love variety clean tones your lighter stuff good overdriven rock tones faster paced songs what surprises me fender has strongly marketed amp people who play heavy music was worried heavier amp models would be nearly good was wrong stack can get nice grungy or crunchy like m pretty sure mesa boogie type model certainly your metallica amp metal all your nu metal needs can be pulled back little play some cool thrash sounds too big bonus heavy guitarists opinion though supersonic amp has lot great character can make bluesy or really make heavy bold play metal thrash or whatever if overdrive built pedal can get some great raw heavy tones out play some metal hard rock well classic blues stuff like personally will play all heavy stuff supersonic amp fact can take any these basic amps layer effects pedals them gives absolutely infinite combinations tones can one guy who sets all presets vintage tones another guy who has all presets filled metal thrash limitless would without doubt choose amp over any modeling amp out there practice fun own pimped out mim strat off rack classic vibe strat tele well les paul style they all sound very cool amp classic vibe strat really impresses me through amp so versatile so many great sounds such high quality sound am really loving amp can play really really loud watts can also play great tone at very low volumes kids practice at night amp perfect fender fuse ableton softwarei admit really don feel lot need dive too much deeper into sound editing than what can do manually amp however ll find amazing tones all over fender fuse system super easy use store your amp any open online forum will wade through tones don love aren described well will find some gems too had time dive into ableton recording software yet so will save review later final wordi am father who needs an amp sounds great at low volumes like vintage tones much heavy stuff so like variety tones hate overprocessed tones amp perfect me perfect amp models great factory installed presets great variety usable sounds comes built tuner tap tempo effects two button footswitch an effects loop digital interface deep editing computer software headphone jack usb port recording software moreat amp costs less than effects pedals

A2Z89YMZZJWBHS	B004TGVRDA	decided try out m5 order add some more effects options while replacing tuner analog delay pedal board while haven explored all sounds yet found some useable ones really need start off by finding dialing effects like creating your own presets flipping through all categories individual effects really practical any live performance situation also factory settings almost never where need them be these devices because source signals from different instruments vary so much here some ve personally found be appealing so far delay analog w mod nice sounding memory man style delay once dial overwhelm your source signalreverb room standard adjustable digital delay truly authentic by any stretch does trick when played over other musicenvelope filter tron up winner fully functional authentic envelope follower funky synthy seeker very cool filter single notes octave bass octaver one note below only quite effective especially loopers will also find expected multi effects pedal many unpractical downright silly sounding noise makers say won find use them here or there they really exist filler unless we re talking about headphones session also don depend any strong distortions from unit unless re using an addition your amp lead channel construction seems pretty sturdy other than model select button which multi use knob push down turn action cheapy cheap awkward uncomfortable use fortunately only really need while setting unit up already dislodged from its proper vertical position once while making presets having choice between true bypass dsp really nice touch unheard stomp boxes people different needs here depending your signal chain tuner quite functional if little tough read from standing position do miss korg pitchblack its big bright display one does trick saves me another pedal connection personally wanted things like octave envelope phaser etc available me stage without having buy wire all those pedals occasional use individually m5 serving purpose sounds will probably cut audiophile or analog purist they should also be depended any basis your overall tone just large bank fun accents add here there very manageable affordable package	4.0	1330214400

A10APIDAZISWQF	B004TQJ174	great overdrive distortion classic rock music good volume roll off tones at full bore sounds like vh some other 80s rock dudes quiet has very active tone control crunch switch adds touch high end harmonic too much just enough mxr has come around making pedals do what they say they will do now own script phase micro chorus well plan getting others m classic rock player these pedals classic 60s vibe	5.0	1393372800
A1GMWTGXW682GB	B004TQJ174	bought pedal wanting classic distortion find more useful an overdrive pedal distortion range does get hot rat or mxr classic distortion sounds great telecaster tube amp use cigar box also fun tone ranges from distortion metal get more extreme distortion from old hissing boss mega distion an example like pedal has wide array uses build quality seems questionable from mxr others posted box very light knobs seem thinner than other mxr espeacially older ones pedal seems solid makes no noise price demo videos were primary reason bought pedal am happy many distortion pedals each one useful their own way would steer clear if looking pedal metal definately buy if into classic rock twang blues	5.0	1345507200
A3621QMU492VV4	B004TQJ174	well really too expensive give basically same sound no matter how set even crunch button just louder sound very good value unless try out first exactly sound re looking guess why so cheap	1.0	1390780800

ADH0O8UVJOT10	B004TQJ174	wanted review pedal because felt some other reviews were little lukewarm distortion incredibly subjective depends your rig your tastes badass by mxr very nice pedal decent price doesn do metal or super high gain offers some nice classic rock tones can be quite warm if back off tone knob crunch button adds brightness volume may or may be too harsh your setup however tone knob does do pretty good job rolling back high end especially if activate crunch button build quality seems be pretty good though should note while pedal same size other mxr pedals significantly lighter suppose could make more susceptible denting damage if travels should be plenty durable users really like switch one too easy press clearly clicks once depressed one minor annoyance if use crunch setting blue light which annoyingly bright like an led headlight stays even when pedal itself off can be quite distracting if rely lights your pedal board tell which effects really major gripe detracts from pedal quality frustrating design decision basically if get right setup ll get great tone got pedal specifically try find better alternative boss ds which lacks mids can sound harsh abrasive mxr badass definitely superior regard lot will depend your rig settings find pedal really excels playing single notes lower strings think walk way by aerosmith or hangingaround intro by counting crows if pair fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal could probably thicken up bit higher solos great pedal	5.0	1348272000

ACY9QYNDFLVBI	B005OZE9SA	use little guy connection daw digital piano run piano sounds through balanced cables into line ports recording also run vst intruments daw trigger via usb midi from piano use device digital audio conversion listen through sennheser hd headhphones plugged also some studio monitors attached using balanced cables purchased upgrade from previous audio interface behringer uf0202 device worked quite well purpose well lacked two things volume knob balanced outs volume knob thing could work around current monitors seem susceptible ground loops even ground lift plug so needed go balanced cables m glad did balanced cables completely eliminated noise problems was good purchase however would say anyone who doesn need balanced cables budget they should consider behringer tiny fraction price works pretty well further class complaint so don use behringer drivers plug play some good things say about focusrite scarlett 2i2 all about hardware some bad things all about software ve tried using driver version which came disk udpated which downloaded from focusrite website let know what need an interface balanced stereo out2 high quality headphone amp3 volume knobs headphone amp main line4 good digital analog conversion5 low output latency input latency important me don use mic preamps which one big selling points device good box simple well designed does what want has very convenient controls has high build quality m pleased digital analog conversion has great big volume knob another headphone amp has switches so each input can be line or microphone pre amp has switch zero latency monitoring whatever coming headphone amp was particular concern me use headphones lot poor headphone amp can be quite problem behringer headphone amp was only ok specifically has an output impedance ohms rule thumb good headphone amp matching output impedance should be impedance headphones hd ohms impedance breaking rule get distortions frequency response case mostly meant attenuation bass most manufacturers don list their output impedance possibly because they embarrassed anyway focusrite does which one reason trust them little more output impedance less than ohms respectable amazing still low would need principle can notice an improvement bass response headphones there plenty extra voltage here too so could drive higher impedance cans if necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced ins outs work very well ins accommodates trs style xlr light around them shows when something actually coming shines red when danger clipping there lots gain available them turned all way down almost outs trs style balanced or unbalanced located back like look box red metal case front back sturdy attractive well usb cable just type b port means can replace if gets damaged or whatever behringer example was hard wired its cable king annoying bus powered actually would been fine wall wart even more simple really no complaints whatsoever about hardware bad driver thing horrible under windows xp clean installation nothing installed except daw software acrobat reader driver mean computer really stripped down performance using behringer was good latency time between playing note hearing out speakers was ms using behringer which isn really perceptible unfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently doesn anything like an acceptable latency lowest latency could set at get sound out instead crackles pops was ms at level instrument begins sound very sluggish laggy very difficult at least me work large latency like was ready return device when decided last ditch effort install asio4all sort an asio driver use if absolutely cannot make manufacturer driver perform at decent level installed worked output latency was tiny ms only which actually output latency so really impressive conclude hardware very very good machine software horrible unfortunately can actually uninstall focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn recognize device never even turns class compliant unlike behringer so now two drivers installed only one which use bad news configuration very buggy general when just turn computer try play vst instrument all get crackles pops until open asio configuration panel increase buffer funny thing doesn matter where buffer starts out always increase before get any good sounds out can start out huge buffer lots latency will crackle until open increase buffer yet more do every time turn computer also sometimes if leave while come back will be crackly again until increase yet another step we talking about major bugs here decided try ditching asio4all trying make focusrite drivers work again maybe there was setting was missing was trying set buffer size heard sound an explosion then computer rebooted when came back couldn get good sounds out even when turned buffer way up tried rebooting few more times still didn work so uninstalled re installed focusrite software at first didn work had install asio4all well now can sort get sounds out half time hope getting idea these drivers terrible awful monkey could written better driver would give star if wasn fact device works very very well when all stars align driver recognizes drive allows play guess m willing sacrifice convenience stability nice hardware when works would never use live situation or when time critical good thing about drivers they can update fix them m hoping they already revised driver once which amazing because even driver seriously an abomination just like closing thoughts unfortunately there really isn usb interface has good driver behringer driver always worked if moved interface from one usb port other was no longer recognized had reinstall driver however didn use behringer driver asio4all would give ms perform without any complications about trouble free ve seen type device if read about presonus audiobox usb m audio fast track pro probably two closest competitors focusrite what get bunch comments just like one horrible horrible drivers never get fixed actually mackie makes competitor well onyx blackjack reviews show driver possibly even worse than one unfortunately none pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers so we live unstable systems only work half time maybe better under mac don know interestingly really only usb device range quite shocking considering how long usb standard has been around only real implication usb devices like m audio presonus can only do two channel audio or out both at same time there enough throughput usb so light competition focusrite looks kind ok unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers at least range device think there no need good hardware especially good software at least hardware one up spec we can cross our fingers improved drivers future bottom line fantastic star device if can make software work consistently if tight budget or don care about balanced out d recommend go behringer uca202 or ufo2020 they tons cheaper class complaint better drivers if use high impedance headphone even headphone amp pretty good one update may new version driver came out since writing above new driver actually works stopped using asio4all get decent latency once while too often will inexplicably require me edit settings increase buffer some percentage time when do will reboot computer if don change anything most time works ok would never use mission critical setting e gigging or pro work home use good enough now if issues driver definitely update	3.0	1322179200

important me mostly workflow related someone who grew up home recording analog equipment if want all details full functionality d recommend downloading manual from tascam or dealer site offers speaking manual found be essential at least at first there so many features will likely take some time explore incorporate them so having copy handy or better yet downloading second copy good idea picky found larger size dp manual easier read handle than smaller dp 008ex ve used software based daws years while enjoy midi recording mixing editing them basic audio tracking never felt comfortable or spontaneous when used analog equipment one room home studio minimal acoustic treatment aside from pc noise miss simplicity tactile response old mk ii cassette track instant power press record pause ready set go granted don miss wall hiss plagued those recordings had fun capturing lot musical moments using hardware control surface daw didn solve problem just find reality booting windows dealing inevitable patching other software distractions be too toxic creative moment especially when recording acoustic instruments hoped dp 008ex would provide some older experience digital audio quality size would integrate easily existing setup bottom line me does doesn first some comparison points may be obvious from product images descriptions size wise difference between pocket studios roughly x x inches versus x x inches tascam doesn provide case or cover dp 008ex larger ereader or tablet case should do fine d recommend one if plan portable use plastic appears fairly durable still plastic knobs dp 008ex smaller diameter lower rounded tops compared those dp however find their slightly rubbery matte finish just easy grip also find smaller circular dp 008ex don protrude above surface much larger bar shaped buttons dp less comfortable use data wheel identical size has bit less resistance dp 008ex which prefer wheel gets workout want responsiveness when selecting from menus ll need dedicated ps p520 5v power supply dp 008ex 12v ps 1225l dp can be shared plug won fit so can fry don even think using batteries when recording anything take seriously other hand teac rc 3f footswitch sharable ll need mini plug phone adaptor think indispensable if re working alone speaking power strong plus both recorders me deal breaker were present phantom mic power so re limited built stereo condensers they re bad rough work unlike mic stand mounted portables would be challenge position unit close some instruments vocals can get decent acoustic piano recording good sounding room close mic recording acoustic or electric amp violin or percussion want flexibility mic stand better quality mics like resistance faders dp can understand how lack real estate kept them off dp 008ex there no cd burner either smaller unit usb transfer capability an issue me having similar xlr phono rca jacks along back edge both units an acquired taste m bothered by because space run cables worth considering your physical layout whether works led screen appears be identical size both units leads me main workflow issues flat positioning screen makes using unit flat surface less comfortable than should be especially since menu used so much slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking design trouble do woodworking made myself simple stand slants at degrees doesn interfere jack access makes tremendous difference neck upper back while reading screen general use tascam should consider similar accessory software largely same both units aside from additional mastering tools essentially packaged presets here lies major criticism feel real conflict between directly accessing functionality e levels eq arming tracks dedicated knobs buttons being forced indirectly access other functionality using what see an inflexible constraining menu system if there were some way customize menu navigation equivalent software hot keys possible frequent repetition non functional steps such pressing home button selecting wheel would wear me much they do best evidence an unbalanced design see dedicated phantom power button both units whose purpose display phantom screen where then make selection turn power off crystallizes me hybrid character compromises made here between software based recording using dedicated hardware recorder when space knobs buttons severely limited can understand design thinking trade offs drive having so much functionality accessible through menu dp 008ex stuffed knobs buttons even first multi tracker fostex x effectively doubled up functionality two tracks cover four so question whether trade offs tascam made here fact diminish user experience connectivity software based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving believe market dedicated hardware recorders such dp 008ex will be largely made up people like me who grew up older recorders looking recapture some experience think tascam would be well served taking into account ve always liked design tascam gear just looks feels well made still large part true dp 008ex can help believing simple digital equivalent old mk ii cassette track would satisfy lot people out there

A14JBDSWKPKTZA	B00BG6ZM0K	everything keeps improving getting better faster cheaper at price point their isn one available isn compromise one way or another first off if planning buying us don buy its bigger brother us getting an optical connection additional ins outs such little bit more money well 192k makes no brainer get optical only at price great d d converters leave bit be desired other hand mic pres pretty good distortion ratings thd only bit 192khz recording make these best sounding interfaces put out by tascam date what meant by compromise even interfaces cost times price most them either good mic pres weak clocks or vice versa some work windows so well mac once again vice versa etc researched interfaces long long time considering non crash reliability dozen other factors finally sprung anrme fireface ufx usb or firewire high performance audio interface out now an interface been running pro tools since pro tools professional audio recording music creation softwareis out pro tools now being released so if looking an inexpensive interface expect some compromises one area or another rather than slam out performance specs under microscope would rather provide review helping those who interested setting up tascam us or so can save lot time trying figure out sometimes little help makes huge difference amount time saved so what did was load register free included cubase le6 complete activation elicense registration installation well installing tascam driver doing updates both know lot reviews here just downloaded driver used their existing daw order test out interface therefore they didn need spend much time don blame them shortest distance between two points straight line so get out cup coffee because installing complete package doesn happen just one hour so here goes if windows vista probably out luck because system requirements list windows xp am sure omission vista mistake know mylogitech audiohub notebook speakersare non functional vista laptop if running windows media center well works win just fine so installed desktop running windows bit gives option installing or addition cubase le also installed ai elements well agent one content groove agent one vintage beat boxes steinberg drum loop expansion which took good amount time load well steinberg halion sonic se bit ai elements then had activate register cubase le6 which involves installing latest elcc creating steinberg account which free they don ask credit card they provide an activation code after register an ilok pro tools which usb device enables run program cubase does require one although they an equivalent looking device fortunately they software based equivalent they do an elicense which will then update version there an elicense control setup soft elicenser number will use order generate activation code generated at steinberg site what came disc was version which they instruct immediately do an update which did version so we install tascam interface next which comes separate dvd included interface foot usb printer style cable will need install driver disc before connecting your computer windows recognizes fails automatically load driver so install driver off disc first then do update took at least minutes do update what flashed screen was megabytes then all see an install screen scrolling series round objects moving at first says going take long time they were exactly right almost tempts think something wrong because nothing happening other than scrolling then finally after ten minutes or so dialogue box comes up says do want install click continue then comes up again another minute happens few times then finally changes over an installation finished box verizon fios usually download huge amount data flash then reboot now important plug us directly into an available usb port into hub even if powered hub simply won work tried light wouldn even come indicating usb when went direct interface lit up worked manuals also warn use usb us comes printed quick start guide there also an owner manual both interface cubase available either dvd or by googling same they come up pdf download if new setting up interfaces be prepared do good deal reading there driver choose input output settings well going into windows control panel sound order choose interface playback recording if re new these kinds setups just take your time don be dismayed if something doesn work all takes one button get pushed wahlah sound example cubase there monitoring button without won get any sound from headphones if all else fails can go tascam web site by googling tascam us then click support tab they pay phone call number order help hope helps ps real killer deal right now avid pro tools bundle mbox mini which another limited interface getting pro tools plus purchases bundle made after has pro tools will be able free upgrade pro tools if register your product avid considering what pro tools goes by itself what mbox sells individually bundle even comes ilok can sell used what paying even more than paying if take advantage discounts seen pop up much off already low price then pro tools full blown versions none le stuff an interface can grow from there tascam interface works great pro tools these pro tools bundles discounted make way am seeing music stores running out them they clearing shelves preparing has bugs rarely purchase totally new versions until they time season some get feedback from users after some time more updates will be browsing shelves discounts upgrade maybe another year pt all

A14JBDSWKPKTZA	B00GTSM8FW	been playing more years than care admit okay bought telecaster brand new back then still love lot different guitars mostly electric acoustics electrics love extra light gauge strings only about us do can fly those do things at pace lot more difficult heavier gauge strings anyhow digress reason light gauge strings subject tuning problems if big fat frets like found gibons esp ltd when squeeze string fret light gauge strings all too easy squeeze all way fret board x large jumbo frets can be quite distance making go out tune cure using heavier gauge strings such or more so makes possible determine quite easily just where top fret without doing full squeeze all way fret board so most capo work up because there lot more tension strings so lot capos can create comfortable fit fully fretting strings without them going into sharp note zone so since use lighter gauge strings even subject same limitation had hard time finding capo would sit comfortably at top range between fret board still squeeze string sufficiently so create any buzz do so without making string too sharp guess what now found several capos none them make grade light gauge strings except one be honest was surprised when worked okay so here how put test used snark headstock tuner which great little tuner if know secret using also peterson hd tuner bench model which fodder another post its one tenth one cent tuning accuracy okay back explanation snark tune open string until line stays center without wavering off one side only problem most any headstock tuner seen they aren superbly accurate peterson headstock tuner sent back because was acting crazy anyhow so secret using snark which like best out headstock tuners tried tune open string first then fret string let say 5th fret will occasionally find string open position registers being tune even though may be little sharp or little flat so when strum whole chord will get desire tune so your ears can hear order get spot there nothing more beautiful than perfectly tuned nothing worse than one well out tune so by tuning open string then tuning fretted string once both tune right so open position if by chance tiny bit sharp enough register tuner when fret string example 5th fret naturally stretches string little bit making sharper which will now show snark note too sharp once balance open string fretted string really wonderfully tuned instrument don even need hear so your audience listening tune up yet get right sweet spot we all love know so well so being said can more fully understand why d addario ns artist capo cat meow first tuner ever used kept perfectly tune after clamping neck adjustable like others one sensitive light gauge strings well often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting capo one even light gauge strings must admit was surprised taking right out wrapper after going through above tuning procedure get spot immediately did job just right wasn even little bit sharp be super critical here another tip when using capo put closer fret rather than middle between two frets some reason stretches string less doing so has do tension resistance at steeper angle right alongside fret rather than farther way like middle between two frets did get tiny bit sharpness when positioned between two frets gauge strings since two most important factors comfortable use getting way when playing open chords keeping tune best way use capo simply clamp strings right above second fret example rather than right below third one right below third one gives perfect tune also just like right above second one does keeps capo way out your way matter fact am so accustomed using capo position know where finger chords sometimes make mistake fret them one lower than they belong little practice or even looking at instantly corrects say quite simply say use capo farther away from your hand just slide down being right above fret below rather than right below fret above so there capo does job perfectly light easy clamp course if can accurately handle will breeze through anything thicker out box set at its lightest setting perfect telecaster tried teles strats really same neck just different head stocks so will work same both so guess can recommend capo high enough since only one works perfectly super light gauge strings only problem being sure remember which case so can switch over when using different might get another one backup	5.0	1402704000
